# This file contains a list of primitives that TA3 systems expect to be available
# for execution by any TA2 system.  Changes to this list should be vetted by the
# TA3/TA2 API working group to ensure that all parties agree on content - failure to support
# a primitive in this list may make a TA2 system incompatible with a TA3 for purposes of
# evaluation.
#
# Primitives are described using metadata values:
# id, version, name, python_path, digest
