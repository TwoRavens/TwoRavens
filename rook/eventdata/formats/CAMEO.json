In addition to unspecified acts of fighting, “killings” of any kind when the weapons used are not specified should also be coded here. When news leads refer to acts of killing that take place during an attack or some form of military engagement as “murders”, those should still be coded here. However, murders in general—as criminal acts with no political connotations—are not coded under the CAMEO framework. The first example below illustrates how one can differentiate between these two different uses of the verb “murder”."
