Note that this dataset has two problems 56_sunspots_problem_annual and 56_sunspots_monthly and two solutions 56_sunspots_solution_annual and 56_sunspots_solution_monthly. However, because we have fixed the names of the views as TRAIN, TEST, and SCORE, we cannot have views for both problems here. Therefore, we are providing views for only one one of them, which is 56_sunspots_annual. This is a limitation in our current structure. A workaround would be to make two totally separate datasets for the two problems. Likewise, mitll_predictions.csv also correspond to 56_sunspots_problem_annual.
