    "problemDescription": "The task here is to predict the median debt-to-earnings ratio of colleges across the US. The supplied dataset consists of the College Scorecards dataset which make it easier for students to search for a college that is a good fit for them. They can use the College Scorecard to find out more about a college's affordability and value so they can make more informed decisions about which college to attend, including factors such as median debt-to-earning ratio of graduates. This is a regression problem.",
