Chase and Dummer stratified their sample, selecting students from urban, suburban, and rural school districts with approximately 1/3 of their sample coming from each district.  Students indicated whether good grades, athletic ability, or popularity was most important to them.  They also ranked four factors:  grades, sports, looks, and money, in order of their importance for popularity.  The questionnaire also asked for gender, grade level, and other demographic information.\nNumber of cases:   478\nVariable Names:\n\nGender:   Boy or girl\nGrade:   4, 5 or 6\nAge:   Age in years\nRace:   White, Other\nUrban/Rural:   Rural, Suburban, or Urban school district\nSchool:   Brentwood Elementary, Brentwood Middle, Ridge, Sand, Eureka, Brown, Main, Portage, Westdale Middle\nGoals:   Student's choice in the personal goals question where options were 1 = Make Good Grades,  2 = Be Popular,  3 = Be Good in Sports\nGrades:   Rank of \"make good grades\"  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nSports:   Rank of \"being good at sports\"  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nLooks:   Rank of \"being handsome or pretty\"  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)\nMoney:   Rank of \"having lots of money\"  (1=most important for popularity, 4=least important)",
