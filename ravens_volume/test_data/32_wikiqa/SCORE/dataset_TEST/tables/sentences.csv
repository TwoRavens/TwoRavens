5,"In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path ."
6,"It can be uniform , with constant angular rate of rotation ( and constant speed ) , or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation ."
7,The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts .
8,The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body .
9,"Examples of circular motion include : an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height , a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles , a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism ."
10,"Since the object 's velocity vector is constantly changing direction , the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation ."
11,"Without this acceleration , the object would move in a straight line , according to Newton 's laws of motion ."

20,"In the United States , the title of federal judge usually means a judge appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution ."
21,"In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals ( also called `` circuit courts '' ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts ."
22,"Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court , Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts ."
23,All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as `` Article III judges '' because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution .

30,Variable Universal Life Insurance ( often shortened to VUL ) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value .
31,"In a VUL , the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts , similar to mutual funds , and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner ."
32,The 'variable ' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets .
33,The 'universal ' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments .
34,The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance .
35,"This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically can not be missed without lapsing the policy ( although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature , or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium ) ."
36,"Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance , because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy ."
37,"With most if not all VULs , unlike whole life , there is no endowment age ( the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount , which for whole life is typically 100 ) ."
38,This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life .
39,"With a typical whole life policy , the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy , and at endowment age , the face amount is all that is paid out ."
40,"Thus with either death or endowment , the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years ."
41,"However , some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase `` paid up additions '' to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time ."
42,"If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company , a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life ."
43,"The combination over the years of no endowment age , continually increasing death benefit , and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy , this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums ."

63,A sebaceous cyst ( ) is a term that loosely refers to either epidermoid cysts ( also known as epidermal cysts ; L72.0 ) or pilar cysts ( also known as trichilemmal cysts ; L72.1 ) .
64,"Because an epidermoid cyst originates in the epidermis and a pilar cyst originates from hair follicles , by definition , neither type of cyst is strictly a sebaceous cyst ."
65,"The name is regarded as a misnomer as the fatty , white , semi-solid material in both of these cyst entities is not sebum , but keratin ."
66,"Furthermore , under the microscope neither entity contains sebaceous glands ."
67,"In practice , however , the terms are often used interchangeably ."

226,"It has been economically infeasible for many years , but with rising oil prices , more companies are investing in this area ."
227,"Major companies working in this sector include Diamond Offshore , TransOcean , and Baker Hughes ."
228,There are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs : semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships .
229,Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar ( platform ) or tension-leg platform .
230,Recent industry analysis has estimated that the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure market will reach $ 145bn in 2011 .
231,“Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water .
232,"You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.” ... Using sonic equipment , oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil ."
233,Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit ( MODU ) to dig the initial well .
234,"Some units are converted into production rigs , meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it 's found ."
235,"Most of the time , the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.” ... The MODU 's job is to drill down into the ocean 's floor to find oil deposits ."
236,The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser .
237,The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig .
238,Engineers lower a drill string -- a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit -- through the riser.”
239,“The expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields ... ”
240,In 2010 a large explosion occurred killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico while a BP oil rig was drilling in deep waters .
241,"“ ... Despite the risks , the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the Mediterranean and off the coast of East Africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas.”"
242,"“The reason for the resumption of such drilling , analyst say , is continuing high demand for energy worldwide.”"
243,America needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that come with deepwater drilling in order for Americans to continue to carry on their everyday lives .
244,"“The Energy Department recently projected that gulf oil production would expand from its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day , still nearly a quarter of total domestic production , to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.”"
245,Deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways .
246,Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome .
247,Oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive .
248,On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too .
249,In time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in .
250,Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen .

285,"Unlike mosses , they have xylem and phloem ( making them vascular plants ) ."
286,"They have stems , leaves , and roots like other vascular plants ."
287,Ferns reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers .
288,"By far the largest group of ferns is the leptosporangiate ferns , but ferns as defined here ( also called monilophytes ) include horsetails , whisk ferns , marattioid ferns , and ophioglossoid ferns ."
289,The term pteridophyte also refers to ferns and a few other seedless vascular plants ( see classification section below ) .

294,Flat roofs in Israel
295,Flat roof in Los Angeles
296,A flat roof is a type of covering for a building .
297,"In contrast to the more sloped form of roof , a flat roof is horizontal or nearly horizontal ."
298,"The slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch : Roofs which are nearly flat are known as low-pitch roofs ( as the angle of slope increases , so the pitch is said to increase ) ."
299,Any sheet of material used to cover a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof area .
300,Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system .
301,"Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof , though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry ."
302,"Gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground , or better , into a specially made soakaway ."
303,Gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area .
304,"Occasionally flat roofs though are designed to collect water in a pool , usually for aesthetic purposes , or for rainwater buffering ."
305,Flat roofs exist all over the world and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials used .
306,"In warmer climes where rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur , many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available ."
307,"In areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak , or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to 'blowing ' ( breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms ) these roofs are not suitable ."
308,Traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertight .
309,"The tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the sun 's heat , UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation ."
310,"Roof decking is usually of plywood , chipboard or OSB boards ( OSB = Oriented Strand Board , also known as Sterling board ) of around 18mm thickness ."
311,"The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid , heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper ' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled , the gravel is spread evenly over it ."
312,"A main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing , thus exposing it to weather and sun whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets in ."
313,Tarpaper is usually a 'paper ' or fibre material soaked or impregnated in tar .
314,"As gravel can not protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands , tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel applied to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of gravel is stuck to it in order to give it ongoing protection ."
315,Tarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful results .
316,"In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic ' tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them , however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable ."
317,There are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of their performance and availability .
318,If a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath it .
319,This can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure .
320,There are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores : the severity of this health risk remains a debated point .
321,One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering ( be it traditional or a modern membrane ) it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen .
322,Thus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair it .
323,Once underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens .
324,A CD-ROM ( ) is a pre-pressed compact disc which contains data .
325,The name is an acronym which stands for `` Compact Disc Read-only memory `` .
326,"Computers can read CD-ROMs , but can not write on them ."
327,"CD-ROMs are popularly used to distribute computer software , including video games and multimedia applications , though any data can be stored ( up to the capacity limit of a disc ) ."
328,"Some CDs , called enhanced CDs , hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player , while data ( such as software or digital video ) is only usable on a computer ( such as ISO 9660 format PC CD-ROMs ) ."
329,The Yellow Book is the technical standard that defines the format of CD-ROMs .
330,"One of a set of color-bound books that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats , the Yellow Book , created by Sony and Philips , was the first extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio ."
331,It adapted the format to hold any form of data .
332,"Joanne `` Jo '' Rowling ( ) , ( born 31 July 1965 ) , pen name J. K. Rowling , is a British novelist , best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series ."
333,"The Potter books have gained worldwide attention , won multiple awards , and sold more than 400 million copies ."

335,Rowling had overall approval on the scripts as well as maintaining creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment .
336,"Born in Yate , Gloucestershire , Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 ."
337,"The seven-year period that followed entailed the death of her mother , divorce from her first husband and poverty until Rowling finished the first novel in the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( 1997 ) ."
338,"Rowling subsequently published 6 sequels—the last , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ( 2007 ) —as well as 3 supplements to the series ."
339,"In 2012 , Rowling parted with her agency and resumed writing in the form of a tragicomedy novel aimed at adult readership , entitled The Casual Vacancy ."
340,"Rowling has said she is currently working on two books—one aimed for adults , the other for children younger than the Harry Potter audience , and she expects the latter to be published first ."
341,"Rowling has led a `` rags to riches `` life story , in which she progressed from living on state benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years ."
342,"She is the United Kingdom 's best-selling author since records began , with sales in excess of £238m ."
343,"The 2008 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling 's fortune at £560 million ( $ 798 million ) , ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the United Kingdom ."
344,"Forbes ranked Rowling as the forty-eighth most powerful celebrity of 2007 , and TIME magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year , noting the social , moral , and political inspiration she has given her fans ."
345,"In October 2010 , Rowling was named the `` Most Influential Woman in Britain '' by leading magazine editors ."

351,Hurricane Isabel ( 2003 ) as seen from orbit during Expedition 7 of the International Space Station .
352,"The eye , eyewall , and surrounding rainbands , characteristics of tropical cyclones , are clearly visible in this view from space ."
353,A tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center surrounded by a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain .
354,"Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises , resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air ."
355,"They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters , European windstorms , and polar lows ."
356,"The characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere , the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings ; a phenomenon called `` warm core `` storm systems ."
357,"The term `` tropical '' refers both to the geographical origin of these systems , which usually form in tropical regions of the globe , and to their formation in maritime tropical air masses ."
358,"The term `` cyclone '' refers to such storms ' cyclonic nature , with counterclockwise wind flow in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern Hemisphere ."
359,The opposite direction of the wind flow is a result of the Coriolis force .
360,"Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane ( , ) , typhoon ( ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone ."
361,"While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain , they are also able to produce high waves , damaging storm surge , and tornadoes ."
362,"They develop over large bodies of warm water , and lose their strength if they move over land due to increased surface friction and loss of the warm ocean as an energy source ."
363,"This is why coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone , while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong winds ."
364,"Heavy rains , however , can produce significant flooding inland , and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline ."
365,"Although their effects on human populations can be devastating , tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions ."
366,"They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes , which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism ."
367,"As a result , tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth 's troposphere , and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide ."
368,Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable .
369,"The background environment is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the Madden-Julian oscillation , El Niño-Southern Oscillation , and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation ."
370,Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics .
371,"Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere ; if the conditions remain favorable , the tropical disturbance intensifies , and can even develop an eye ."
372,"On the other end of the spectrum , if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall , the system weakens and eventually dissipates ."
373,It is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology .

414,The Dominican Republic annexation treaty caused bitter contention between President Grant and Sen. Sumner .
415,Brady 1869 ] ]
416,"Sen. Sumner , opposed to American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti , became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty , and that men close to the president shared in the corruption ."
417,"As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Sen. Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18 , 1870 ."
418,"Sen. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State , Bancroft Davis , that U.S . Naval ships were being used to protect President Báez ."
419,"Sen. Sumner 's committee voted against annexation and at Sen. Sumner’s suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment , the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session ."
420,"President Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14 , 1870 , and May 31 , 1870 ."
421,"In closed session , Sen. Sumner spoke out against the treaty ; warnng that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals , noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island , and the risk that the independence of Haiti , recognized by the United States in 1862 , would be lost ."
422,Sumner stated that Grant 's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional .
423,"Finally , on June 30 , 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage ."
424,"The following day , President Grant , feeling betrayed by Sen. Sumner , retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner’s close friend J. Lothrop Motley , Ambassador to Britain ."
425,"By autumn , Sumner 's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge , and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned , rather than let Grant have his way ."
426,"The two men , friends until then , cooled into bitter enemies ."
427,"In December , 1870 , still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow , Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct ."
428,"Already , President Grant , supported by his Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ."
429,"Although Sumner stated he was an `` Administration man '' , in addition to having stopped Grant 's Dominican Republic treaty attempt , Sumner had defeated Grant 's full repeal of the Tenure of Office Act , blocked Grant 's nomination of Alexander Stewart to U.S. Secretary of Treasury , and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go ."
430,"Grant resented Sumner 's superiority of manner , as well ."
431,"Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible , the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised : `` he did n't write it . ''"
432,"As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased , Sumner’s health began to decline ."

434,Business ethics ( also corporate ethics ) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment .
435,It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations .
436,Business ethics has both normative and descriptive dimensions .
437,"As a corporate practice and a career specialization , the field is primarily normative ."
438,Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods .
439,The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns .
440,"Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s , both within major corporations and within academia ."
441,"For example , today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters ."
442,"Adam Smith said , `` People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ''"
443,Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions .
444,Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control .
445,The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes .
446,"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation ."
447,Most burns affect only the superficial skin ( known as superficial or first degree ) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin ( known as partial thickness or second degree ) .
448,"Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues , such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness ( third degree ) or fourth degree ."
449,The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn .
450,Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers .
451,Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low body temperature .
452,Partial thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings .
453,Blisters should typically be left unbroken .
454,Full thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting and extensive burns often require large amount of intravenous fluids .

460,"The Atlantic Ocean , not including Arctic and Antarctic regions"
461,This video was taken by the crew of Expedition 29 on board the ISS .
462,"The pass starts from just north-east of the Island of Newfoundland over the North Atlantic Ocean to central Africa , over South Sudan ."
463,The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world 's oceanic divisions .
464,"With a total area of about , it covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth 's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area ."
465,"The first part of its name refers to Atlas of Greek mythology , making the Atlantic the `` Sea of Atlas '' ."
466,The oldest known mention of `` Atlantic '' is in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC ( Hdt . 1.202.4 ) : Atlantis thalassa ( Greek : Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα ; English : Sea of Atlas ) .
467,"The term Ethiopic Ocean , derived from Ethiopia , was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century ."
468,"Before Europeans discovered other oceans , the term `` ocean '' itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the Strait of Gibraltar that we now know as the Atlantic ."
469,The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a gigantic river encircling the world .
470,"The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated , S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east , and the Americas to the west ."
471,"As one component of the interconnected global ocean , it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean ( which is sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic ) , to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest , the Indian Ocean in the southeast , and the Southern Ocean in the south ."
472,( Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica . )
473,The equator subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean .
474,"Due to their long-term persistence , and the need for a unique identifier in issuing forecasts and warnings , tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are given names according to policy ( see Tropical cyclone naming ) ."
475,The following are lists from which these tropical and subtropical cyclone names are derived .
476,White light is dispersed by a prism into the colors of the optical spectrum .
477,The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to ( can be detected by ) the human eye .
478,Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light .
479,A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm .
480,"In terms of frequency , this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–790 THz ."
481,"A light-adapted eye generally has its maximum sensitivity at around 555 nm ( 540 THz ) , in the green region of the optical spectrum ( see : luminosity function ) ."
482,"The spectrum does not , however , contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguish ."
483,"Unsaturated colors such as pink , or purple variations such as magenta , are absent , for example , because they can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths ."
484,Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors .
485,"Visible wavelengths pass through the `` optical window `` , the region of the electromagnetic spectrum which allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earth 's atmosphere ."
486,"An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths , and so the midday sky appears blue ."
487,The optical window is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum .
488,"The near infrared ( NIR ) window lies just out of the human vision , as well as the Medium Wavelength IR ( MWIR ) window and the Long Wavelength or Far Infrared ( LWIR or FIR ) window though other animals may experience them ."
489,"Many species can see light with frequencies outside the `` visible spectrum , '' which is defined in terms of human vision ."
490,"Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light , which helps them find nectar in flowers ."
491,"Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light , rather than how colorful they appear to humans ."
492,"Birds , too , can see into the ultraviolet ( 300–400 nm ) , and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range ."
493,"Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range , however , can not see red light or any other reddish wavelengths ."
494,"Bees ' visible spectrum ends at about 590nm , just before the orange wavelengths start ."
495,"Birds , however , can see some red wavelengths , but not as many as humans ."
496,Zebras ( or ) are several species of African equids ( horse family ) united by their distinctive black and white stripes .

498,They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds .
499,"Unlike their closest relatives , horses and asses , zebras have never been truly domesticated ."
500,"There are three species of zebras : the plains zebra , the Grévy 's zebra and the mountain zebra ."
501,"The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris , but Grévy 's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus ."
502,"The latter resembles an ass , to which it is closely related , while the former two are more horse-like ."
503,"All three belong to the genus Equus , along with other living equids ."
504,The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people .
505,"They occur in a variety of habitats , such as grasslands , savannas , woodlands , thorny scrublands , mountains , and coastal hills ."
506,"However , various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations , in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction ."
507,Grévy 's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered .
508,"While plains zebras are much more plentiful , one subspecies , the quagga , became extinct in the late 19th century – though there is currently a plan , called the Quagga Project , that aims to breed zebras that are phenotypically similar to the quagga in a process called breeding back ."
509,"Barry White , born Barry Eugene Carter ( – ) , was an American composer and singer-songwriter ."

528,"Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth 's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow , and then transported and deposited in other locations ."
529,"While erosion is a natural process , human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally ."
530,"Excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification , decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation , sedimentation of waterways , and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers ."
531,"Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined , they are responsible for 84 % of degraded acreage , making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems ."
532,"Industrial agriculture , deforestation , roads , anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion ."
533,"However , there are many available alternative land use practices that can curtail or limit erosion , such as terrace -building , no-till agriculture , and revegetation of denuded soils ."

607,Periodic table with electron shells
608,An electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom 's nucleus .
609,"The closest shell to the nucleus is called the `` 1 shell '' ( also called `` K shell '' ) , followed by the `` 2 shell '' ( or `` L shell '' ) , then the `` 3 shell '' ( or `` M shell '' ) , and so on farther and farther from the nucleus ."
610,"The shell letters K , L , M , ... , used in the X-ray notation , are alphabetical ."

683,"Andrew Jackson , the seventh president , was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed ."
684,Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920 .
685,"History records four presidents – John Q Adams , Rutherford B. Hayes , Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – who lost the popular vote but assumed office ."
686,"John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith , and the current president , Barack Obama , is the first president of African descent ."
687,"Several firearms with detachable suppressors , from top to bottom : An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical , A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito ."
688,Bolt action rimfire rifle with suppressor
689,AWM-F sniper rifle with attached suppressor .
690,"A suppressor , sound suppressor , or sound moderator , is a device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm which reduces the amount of noise , and usually the amount of muzzle flash , generated by firing the weapon ."
691,A suppressor can be used both with a firearm and with compressed air gun .
692,"Though it is sometimes referred to as a silencer , this term is a misnomer popularized by cinematic fiction : the sound of a projectile , especially one moving faster than the speed of sound , through the air can not be eliminated ."
693,"Using a suppressor in long distance shooting ( i.e . greater than 300 meters ) can lessen , or retard , the report at the moment of impact , and create the impression of silence near the target ."
694,"The noise heard near the muzzle as a projectile leaves the barrel , though subdued , is not silent at all ."
695,A suppressor is usually a metal cylinder with internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet .
696,Early suppressors were created around the beginning of the 20th century by several inventors .
697,"American inventor Hiram Percy Maxim ( not to be confused with Hiram Stevens Maxim , Hiram Percy 's father , and the inventor of the Maxim Machine Gun ) , is credited with inventing and selling the first commercially successful models circa 1902 ( patented 30 March 1909 ) ."
698,Maxim gave his device the trademarked name Maxim Silencer .
699,"The muffler for internal combustion engines was developed in parallel with the firearm suppressor by Maxim in the early 20th century , using many of the same techniques to provide quieter-running engines ( in many European countries automobile mufflers are still called silencers ) ."
700,"The word silencer in reference to gun suppressor remains in widespread use , although it has since fallen out of favor with some , especially among the firearms industry , being replaced with the more literally accurate term sound suppressor or just suppressor , because a `` sound suppressor '' does not `` silence '' any weapon , rather it eliminates muzzle flash and reduces the sonic pressure of a firearm discharging ."
701,"Common usage and U.S. legislative language favor the historically earlier term , silencer ."
702,"In U.S. law , the terms `` firearm muffler '' and `` firearm silencer '' are synonymous ."
703,"Suppressors were regularly used by agents of the United States Office of Strategic Services , who favored the newly designed High Standard HDM .22 Long Rifle pistol during World War II ."
704,OSS Director William Joseph `` Wild Bill '' Donovan demonstrated the pistol for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House .
705,"According to OSS research chief Stanley Lovell , Donovan ( an old and trusted friend of the President ) was waved into the Oval Office , where Roosevelt was dictating a letter ."
706,"While Roosevelt finished his message , Donovan turned his back and fired ten shots into a sandbag he had brought with him , announced what he had done and handed the smoking gun to the astonished president ."
707,The British SOE ( Special Operations Executive ) Welrod assassination pistol with an integral suppressor was also used by the American OSS on clandestine operations in Nazi occupied Europe during the Second World War .
708,"Beatrice `` Bea '' Arthur ( May 13 , 1922 – April 25 , 2009 ) was an American actress , comedienne , and singer whose career spanned seven decades ."

718,"In the United States , a homeowner association is a corporation formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing , managing , and selling of homes and lots in a residential subdivision ."
719,"It grants the developer privileged voting rights in governing the association , while allowing the developer to exit financial and legal responsibility of the organization , typically by transferring ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling off a predetermined number of lots ."
720,Membership in the homeowners association by a residential buyer is typically a condition of purchase ; a buyer is n't given an option to reject it .
721,"Most homeowner associations are incorporated , and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations ."
722,"State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal , and mainly takes the form of laws which are inconsistent from state to state ."
723,"Some states , such as Florida and California , have a large body of homeowner association law , and some states , such as Massachusetts , have virtually no homeowner association law ."
724,"The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is common-interest developments ( CIDs ) , a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes , condominiums , and cooperative apartments ."
725,"Since 1964 , homeowner associations have become increasingly common in the USA ."
726,The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents in 2010 .

728,There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca . 5000 BC .
729,"Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose , ranging from show breeds with long , flowing hair to those in use as model organisms by science ."
730,"From ca . 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532 , selective breeding by indigenous South American peoples resulted in many varieties of domestic Guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds ."
731,"Early Andean breeds were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food , and efforts at improving the Guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era ."
732,"With the export of Guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century , the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets ."
733,"To this end , various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers ."
734,"The American Cavy Breeders Association , an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association , is the governing body in the United States and Canada ."
735,The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom .
736,Similar organizations exist in Australia ( Australian National Cavy Council ) and New Zealand ( New Zealand Cavy Club ) .
737,Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing .
738,New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century .
739,"Though there are many breeds of Guinea pig , only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets ."
740,Most Guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection .
741,"The short hair , Abyssinian , Peruvian and Sheltie ( aka Silkie ) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets , and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of Guinea pigs ."
742,"In addition to their standard form , nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant ."
743,"Satins , due to their hollow hair shafts , possess coats of a special gloss and shine ."
744,"However , there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the Satin coat also can cause severe bone problems , including Osteodystrophy and Paget 's disease ."
745,Showing Satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders ' associations because of animal welfare reasons .
746,"All cavy breeds have some shared general standards : the head profile should be rounded , with large eyes and large , smooth ears ."
747,The body should be strong and of compact build .
748,Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip .
749,"These standards are best met by long established , commonly bred breeds , as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities ."
750,"The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds , which have had well established , separate breeding lines for different colours ."
751,"State schools ( also known as public schools or government schools ) generally refer to primary or secondary schools mandated for or offered to all children without charge paid for , in whole or in part , by taxation ."
752,"The term may also refer to institutions of post-secondary education funded , in whole or in part , and overseen by government ."
753,The ribosome assembles polymeric protein molecules whose sequence is controlled by the sequence of messenger RNA molecules .
754,This is required by all living cells and associated viruses .
755,"The ribosome ( from ribonucleic acid and the Greek soma , meaning `` body '' ) is a large and complex molecular machine , found within all living cells , that serves as the primary site of biological protein synthesis ( translation ) ."
756,Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules .
757,"Ribosomes consist of two major subunits—the small ribosomal subunit reads the mRNA , while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain ."
758,Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) molecules and a variety of proteins .
759,The sequence of DNA encoding for a protein may be copied many times into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) chains of a similar sequence .
760,Ribosomes can bind to an mRNA chain and use it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular protein .
761,"Amino acids are selected , collected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA ( tRNA molecules ) , which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain ."
762,The attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome .
763,"Once the protein is produced , it can then 'fold ' to produce a specific functional three-dimensional structure ."
764,A ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein .
765,"Each ribosome is divided into two subunits : the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern , while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA and the amino acids ."
766,"When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule , these two subunits split apart ."
767,"Ribosomes are ribozymes , because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA ."
768,"Ribosomes from bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes ( the three domains of life on Earth ) differ in their size , sequence , structure , and the ratio of protein to RNA ."
769,"The differences in structure allow some antibiotics to kill bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes , while leaving human ribosomes unaffected ."
770,"In bacteria and archaea , more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time , each `` reading '' its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule ."
771,"The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria , reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria ."
772,"Albert Claude , Christian de Duve , and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , in 1974 , for the discovery of the ribosomes ."
773,"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for determining the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome ."

775,Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
776,The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose .
777,"These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes ."
778,These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them .
779,"There are three phases to the light-independent reactions , collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation , reduction reactions , and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration ."
780,"Despite its name , this process occurs only when light is available ."
781,Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night .
782,"They , instead , release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves ."
783,"This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work ."
784,"In mathematics , a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer ; in other words , it is the product of some integer with itself ."
785,"For example , 9 is a square number , since it can be written as ."
786,"The usual notation for the formula for the square of a number is not the product , but the equivalent exponentiation , usually pronounced as `` squared '' ."
787,The name square number comes from the name of the shape ; see below .
788,Square numbers are non-negative .
789,"Another way of saying that a ( non-negative ) number is a square number , is that its square roots are again integers ."
790,"For example , = ±3 , so 9 is a square number ."
791,A positive integer that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square-free .
792,"For a non-negative integer , the th square number is , with being the zeroth square ."
793,The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems .
794,"If rational numbers are included , then a square is the ratio of two square integers , and , conversely , the ratio of two square integers is a square ( e.g. , 4/9 = ( 2/3 ) 2 ) ."
795,"Starting with 1 , there are square numbers up to and including , where the expression represents the floor of the number ."
796,The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars .
797,The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican party during the First Party System .
798,"President James Monroe endeavored to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations , with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating parties altogether from national politics ."
799,The period is so closely associated with Monroe 's presidency ( 1817–1825 ) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous .
800,The Era of Good Feelings marked a transition in American politics with the end of the Federalist Party as America began to develop after the War of 1812 .
801,"While America was experiencing growth and prosperity after the war with Britain , this era also marks the first instance of economic troubles in the growing United States ."
802,"Mirroring the American System proposed by Henry Clay , protective tariffs and the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States complicated the tension between the North and South with the coming of the first financial crisis ."
803,"While the term “Era of Good Feelings” is usually viewed with irony because of the political turmoil , economic factors caused animosity between the North and South ."
804,"The designation of the period by historians as one of “good feelings” is often conveyed with irony or skepticism , as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive , especially among factions within the Monroe administration and the Republican Party ."
805,"The phrase “Era of Good Feelings” was coined by Benjamin Russell , in the Boston Federalist newspaper , Columbian Centinel , on July 12 , 1817 , following Monroe 's visit to Boston , Massachusetts as part of his good will tour of America ."
806,"Mariel Margaret `` Mia '' Hamm ( born March 17 , 1972 ) is a retired American professional soccer player ."
807,Hamm played many years as a forward for the United States women 's national soccer team and was a founding member of the Washington Freedom .
808,"Hamm scored 158 international goals , more than any other player , male or female , in the history of soccer and is the third most capped female player in soccer history behind Kristine Lilly and Christie Rampone , appearing in 275 international matches ."
809,"Hamm was named the women 's FIFA World Player of the Year the first two times that award was given ( in 2001 and 2002 ) , and is listed as one of FIFA 's 125 best living players ( as chosen by Pelé ) ."
810,She was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame as well as the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and Texas Sports Hall of Fame .
811,She is the author of Go For the Goal : A Champion 's Guide to Winning in Soccer and Life and appeared in the HBO documentary Dare to Dream : The Story of the U.S. Women 's Soccer Team .
812,"Washington Post columnist Michael Wilbon called Hamm , `` Perhaps the most important athlete of the last 15 years . ''"
813,Hamm takes a corner kick .
814,"The New York Red Bulls is an American professional soccer team based in Harrison , New Jersey , representing the New York metropolitan area ."
815,The team competes in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) .
816,"It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS , having competed in the league since its inception ."
817,"The team was a founding member of MLS ( 1996 ) , but has gone through several name changes ."
818,The team was originally known as the New York/New Jersey MetroStars through 1997 .
819,"From the 1998 season through the 2005 season , the team was known as the MetroStars ."
820,"On March 9 , 2006 , the team was sold to Red Bull GmbH , leading to the team 's current name ."
821,"They are the only original MLS franchise not to have won any significant trophy ( including regular season , playoffs , and knockout competition ) since inception ."
822,The team 's best result in the MLS was the MLS Cup final in 2008 .
823,"In the US Open Cup , the MetroStars reached three semifinals ( 1997 , 1998 , 2000 ) , before reaching their first final in 2003 , losing 1–0 to the Chicago Fire ."
824,"On August 26 , 2000 , the Metros ' Clint Mathis set an MLS record by scoring five goals in a game against the Dallas Burn ."
825,"Some well-known players that have played for the team include Giovanni Savarese , Tim Howard , Tony Meola , Tab Ramos , Alexi Lalas , Clint Mathis , Jozy Altidore , Michael Bradley , Claudio Reyna , Eddie Pope , Roberto Donadoni , Lothar Matthäus , Adolfo Valencia , Youri Djorkaeff , Amado Guevara , Juan Pablo Ángel , Thierry Henry , Juninho Pernambucano , Jan Gunnar Solli , Rafael Márquez , and Tim Cahill ."

827,"Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism are one , a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream , 12th century , Song Dynasty ."
828,"Estimating the number of Buddhists in the world , or in many countries , is difficult due to definitional issues as well as practical problems of enumeration ."
829,"To begin with , the religious beliefs , practices , and identities of East Asians ( who comprise the majority of the world 's Buddhists by any measure ) often blend Buddhism with other traditions including Confucianism , the Chinese folk religion , Daoism , Shinto , and Korean shamanism ."
830,"Most followers of Buddhism do not belong to structured congregations , or observe a definite ritual of adherence such as taking Refuge , making it difficult to accurately estimate the number of practitioners ."
831,An additional challenge is the hostility of several national governments ( often Communist ones such as China or North Korea ) to religion generally or to Buddhism specifically .
832,"Government policies in these countries may encourage the under-reporting or non-reporting of religious adherence , resulting in official totals that may drastically underestimate the number of religious practitioners in these countries ."
833,"Estimate of the worldwide Buddhist population range from 350 million to over one billion , but cluster nearer to the first figure ."
834,Adherents.com ( as of 2012 ) suggests a figure of 397 million .
835,"By major branches , the numbers are as follows:"
836,"( 1 ) Mahayana Buddhism , including East Asian Buddhism , with no fewer than 185 million adherents , and possibly several times that many ( again , depending on definitional issues ) ."
837,"This is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in China , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Singapore , and Vietnam ."
838,"( 2 ) Theravada Buddhism , with no fewer than 125 million adherents ."
839,"This is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia , Thailand , Laos , Sri Lanka , and Burma ."
840,"( 3 ) Vajrayana Buddhism , with approximately 20 million adherents ."
841,"This form predominates in the greater Tibetan and Mongolian regions , as well as in the Himalayas ."
842,"Besides the independent countries of Mongolia and Bhutan , and various territories within what is now western China , Vajrayana is traditional to certain regions of Russia ( e.g . Kalmykia , Buryatia ) , India ( e.g . Ladakh , Sikkim ) , and Nepal ( e.g . Khumbu ) ."
843,"Vajrayana , also known as Tibetan Buddhism , is often conflated with Tantric Buddhism , but this is imprecise , as Shingon and other forms of East Asian Buddhism also practice tantra ."
844,"At least 7 countries ( Sri Lanka , Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Bhutan , and Mongolia ) have unambiguous Buddhist majorities ."
845,"Depending on how one calculates Chinese and other East Asian adherents , this figure might expand to include several more countries ."
846,"In addition , Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia and Bhutan , and receives prominent mention in the constitutions of Thailand and Sri Lanka ."
847,"In northern India and Nepal , the land where Buddhism was born , the religion severely declined during the first millennium ."
848,"Whether this decline was due to the Islamic conquest of northern India , or to other factors , remains controversial ."
849,See the article Decline of Buddhism in India .
850,"James Butler Hickok ( May 27 , 1837 – August 2 , 1876 ) , better known as Wild Bill Hickok , was a folk hero of the American Old West ."
851,"His skills as a gunfighter and scout , along with his reputation as a lawman , provided the basis for his fame , although some of his reported exploits are fictionalized ."
852,"Born and raised on a farm in rural Illinois , Hickok went west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice , first working as a stagecoach driver , before he became a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska ."
853,"He fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War , and gained publicity after the war as a scout , marksman , actor , and professional gambler ."
854,"Between his law-enforcement duties and gambling , which easily overlapped , Hickok was involved in several notable shootouts ."
855,"He was shot and killed while playing poker in the Nuttal & Mann 's Saloon in Deadwood , Dakota Territory ( now South Dakota ) ."
856,Artist 's conception of the Curiosity rover vaporizing rock on Mars .
857,The rover landed on Mars in August 2012 .
858,A Mars rover is an automated motor vehicle which propels itself across the surface of the planet Mars after landing .
859,"Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers : they examine more territory , they can be directed to interesting features , they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control ."
860,There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers .
861,The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Mars Pathfinder mission and its now inactive Sojourner rover .
862,"It currently manages the Mars Exploration Rover mission 's active Opportunity rover and inactive Spirit , and , as part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission , the Curiosity rover ."
863,"A financial audit , or more accurately , an audit of financial statements , is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity , with a view to express an audit opinion ."
864,"The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance , but not absolute assurance , that the financial statements are presented fairly , in all material respects , and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework ."
865,"The purpose of an audit is provide and objective independent examination of the financial statements , which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management , thus increase user confidence in the financial statement , reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements ."
866,Financial audits are typically performed by firms of practicing accountants who are experts in financial reporting .
867,The financial audit is one of many assurance functions provided by accounting firms .
868,"Many organizations separately employ or hire internal auditors , who do not attest to financial reports but focus mainly on the internal controls of the organization ."
869,External auditors may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors .
870,"Auditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization , therefore would likely to reduce of such corporations to conceal unscrupulous dealings ."
871,"Internationally , the International Standards on Auditing ( ISA ) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ( IAASB ) is considered as the benchmark for audit process ."
872,Almost all jurisdictions require auditors to follow the ISA or a local variation of the ISA .
873,"Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold , silver , and base metal versions ."
874,"The term silver dollar is often used for any large white metal coin issued by the United States with a face value of one dollar , although purists insist that a dollar is not silver unless it contains some of that metal ."
875,"Silver dollars , the first dollar coin issue , were minted beginning in 1794 ."
876,Gold dollars and gold-colored dollars have also been produced by the United States .
877,The Sacagawea and Presidential dollars are often referred to as `` golden dollars '' .
878,"In modern times , dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States ."
879,"Despite efforts by the government to promote their use , most Americans currently use the one dollar bill rather than dollar coins ."
880,In straight and level flight lift ( L ) equals weight ( W ) .
881,"In a banked turn of 60° , lift equals double the weight ( L=2W ) ."
882,The pilot experiences 2g and a doubled weight .
883,"The steeper the bank , the greater the g-forces ."
884,This top-fuel dragster can accelerate from zero to in 0.86 seconds .
885,This is a horizontal acceleration of 5.3 g. Combined with the vertical g-force in the stationary case the Pythagorean theorem yields a g force of 5.4 g .
886,g-force ( with g from gravitational ) is a term for accelerations felt as weight and measurable by accelerometers .
887,"It is not a force , per se , but a force per unit mass ."
888,"Since such a force is perceived as a weight , any g-force can be described as a `` weight per unit mass '' ( see the synonym specific weight ) ."
889,"The g-force acceleration acts as a multiplier of weight-like forces for every unit of an object 's mass , and ( save for certain electromagnetic force influences ) is the cause of an object 's acceleration in relation to free-fall ."
890,This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of non-gravitational forces acting on an object free to move .
891,"The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations , and it is only these that are measured in g-force units ."
892,They cause stresses and strains on objects .
893,"Because of these strains , large g-forces may be destructive ."
894,"Gravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force , even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity ."
895,"Thus , the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth 's surface produces g-force only indirectly , as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces ."
896,"The 1 g-force on an object sitting on the Earth 's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground , keeping the object from going into free-fall ."
897,"The upward force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth 's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition , which is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth 's center ."
898,"Objects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation-only , feel no g-force ."
899,"This is demonstrated by the `` zero-g '' conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth 's center ( in vacuum ) , or ( to good approximation ) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit ."
900,These are examples of coordinate acceleration ( a change in velocity ) without a sensation of weight .
901,"The experience of no g-force ( zero-g ) , however it is produced , is synonymous with weightlessness ."
902,"In the absence of gravitational fields , or in directions at right angles to them , proper and coordinate accelerations are the same , and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration ."
903,"An example here is a rocket in free space , in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines , and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers ."
904,"An augur holding a lituus , the curved wand often used as a symbol of augury on Roman coins"
905,"The augur was a priest and official in the classical world , especially ancient Rome and Etruria ."
906,"His main role was to interpret the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds : whether they are flying in groups or alone , what noises they make as they fly , direction of flight and what kind of birds they are ."
907,This was known as `` taking the auspices . ''
908,"The ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society—public or private—including matters of war , commerce , and religion ."
909,"The Roman historian Livy stresses the importance of the augurs : `` Who does not know that this city was founded only after taking the auspices , that everything in war and in peace , at home and abroad , was done only after taking the auspices ? ''"

921,Present-day impression of a Late Bronze Age seal
922,Town seal ( matrix ) of Náchod from 1570
923,"A seal is a device for making an impression in wax , clay , paper , or some other medium , including an embossment on paper , and is also the impression thus made ."
924,"The original purpose was to authenticate a document , a wrapper for one such as a modern envelope , or the cover of a container or package holding valuables or other objects ."
925,"The sealing process is essentially that of a mould , with the final image represented on the device for making the impression by a mirror-image design , incised in sunken- ( or counter- ) relief or intaglio ."
926,"The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die ; the imprint it creates as the seal impression ( or , more rarely , the sealing ) ."
927,"If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch , the seal is known as a dry seal ; in all other cases a liquid or liquified medium ( such as ink or wax ) is used , usually in another color than the paper ."
928,"For legal purposes , the definition of a seal may be extended to include rubber stamps , or writing specified words ( `` seal '' or `` L.S . `` ) ."
929,"In the United States , the word `` seal '' is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design ( in monochrome or color ) , which may be used in a variety of contexts including architectural settings , on flags , or on official letterheads ."
930,"Thus , for example , the Great Seal of the United States , among other uses , appears on the reverse of the one-dollar bill ; and several of the seals of the U.S. states appear on their respective state flags ."
931,"In Europe , although coats of arms and heraldic badges may well feature in such contexts as well as on seals , the seal design in its entirety rarely appears as an emblem ."
932,The study of seals is known as sigillography or sphragistics .
933,"Groundhog Day ( Pennsylvania German : Grundsaudaag , Murmeltiertag ) is a day celebrated on February 2 ."
934,"According to folklore , if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day , then spring will come early ; if it is sunny , the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow , and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks ."
935,Modern customs of the holiday involve celebrations where early morning festivals are held to watch the groundhog emerging from its burrow .
936,"In southeastern Pennsylvania , Groundhog Lodges ( Grundsow Lodges ) celebrate the holiday with fersommlinge , social events in which food is served , speeches are made , and one or more g'spiel ( plays or skits ) are performed for entertainment ."
937,"The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event , and those who speak English pay a penalty , usually in the form of a nickel , dime , or quarter per word spoken , with the money put into a bowl in the center of the table ."
938,"The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney , Pennsylvania ."
939,"Groundhog Day , already a widely recognized and popular tradition , received widespread attention as a result of the 1993 film Groundhog Day , which was set in Punxsutawney , PA ( though filmed primarily in Woodstock , IL ) and portrayed Punxsutawney Phil ."
940,High resolution image of Tampa Bay region
941,"The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate ( Koppen Cfa ) , with warm and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and drier winters with freezing temperatures occurring every 2–3 years ."
942,"The area experiences a significant summer wet season , as nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September ."
943,"The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) as being in hardiness zone 10 , which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown ."
944,Highs usually range between 65 and 95 °F ( 18 and 35 °C ) year round .
945,"Though known for hot summers , Tampa 's official high has never reached 100 °F ( 38 °C ) – the city 's all-time record temperature is 99 °F ( 37 °C ) ."
946,St. Petersburg 's all-time record high is exactly 100 °F ( 38 °C ) .
947,"Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay ."
948,This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere .
949,"In general , the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges , both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year ."
950,"A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum , showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths"
951,The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation .
952,"The `` electromagnetic spectrum '' of an object has a different meaning , and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object ."
953,"The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength ( high-frequency ) end , thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom ."
954,"The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself , while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length , although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous ."
955,"Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions , as ways to study and characterize matter ."
956,"In addition , radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing ( see electromagnetic radiation for more applications ) ."
957,Legend
958,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( or ; January 30 , 1882 – April 12 , 1945 ) , also known by his initials , FDR , was the 32nd President of the United States ( 1933–1945 ) and a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century , leading the United States during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war ."
959,"A dominant leader of the Democratic Party and the only American president elected to more than two terms , he built a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932 , as his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century ."
960,"With the bouncy popular song `` Happy Days Are Here Again `` as his campaign theme , FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932 , at the depth of the Great Depression ."
961,"Energized by his personal victory over polio , FDR 's unfailing optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit ."
962,"He worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II , and restoring prosperity to the nation 's economy ."
963,"In his first hundred days in office , which began March 4 , 1933 , Roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal —a variety of programs designed to produce relief ( government jobs for the unemployed ) , recovery ( economic growth ) , and reform ( through regulation of Wall Street , banks and transportation ) ."
964,"The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , but then relapsed into a deep recession ."
965,The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court or passing any considerable legislation ; it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment diminished during World War II .
966,"Most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975–85 , except for the regulation of Wall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which still exists ."
967,"Along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which was created in 1933 , and Social Security , which Congress passed in 1935 ."
968,"As World War II loomed after 1938 , with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain , while remaining officially neutral ."
969,His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy `` which would supply munitions to the Allies .
970,"In March 1941 , Roosevelt , with Congressional approval , provided Lend-Lease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain ."
971,"With very strong national support , he made war on Japan and Germany after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , calling it a `` date which will live in infamy `` ."
972,He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the Allied war effort .
973,"As an active military leader , Roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the development of the world 's first atom bomb ."
974,"In 1942 Roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians ."
975,"Unemployment dropped to 2 % , relief programs largely ended , and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers , and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service ."

984,"The regulation of prostitution in the United States is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government ; Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit , prohibit , or otherwise regulate commercial sex , except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws like the Mann Act ."
985,"In most states , prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime , a crime that disrupts the order of a community ."
986,It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime .
987,"Currently , Nevada is the only state to allow brothel prostitution , the terms of which are stipulated in the Nevada Revised Statutes ."
988,Only 8 counties currently contain active brothels .
989,"All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County ( which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area ) , Washoe County ( which contains Reno ) , Carson City , Douglas County , and Lincoln County ."
990,"The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution , but some of these counties currently have no active brothels ."
991,"Street prostitution , `` pandering , '' and living off of the proceeds of a prostitute remain illegal under Nevada law , as elsewhere in the country ."
992,"As with other countries , prostitution in the United States can be divided into three broad categories : street prostitution , brothel prostitution , and escort prostitution ."
993,"The national flag of the United States of America , often simply referred to as the American flag , consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red ( top and bottom ) alternating with white , with a blue rectangle in the canton ( referred to specifically as the `` union '' ) bearing fifty small , white , five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars ( top and bottom ) alternating with rows of five stars ."

1003,This is a complete list of congressional districts for representation in the United States House of Representatives .
1004,"The quantity ( apportionment ) and boundaries ( redistricting ) of districts are determined after each census , although in some cases states have changed the boundaries more than once per census ."
1005,This list includes the 435 current and over 200 obsolete districts .
1006,"For example , since the 2000 census , Nebraska has had three districts , but it used to have as many as six ."
1007,"In the first decade of the twenty-first century , Texas had 32 districts , but has since added four due to reapportionment as a result of the 2010 census ."
1008,Other states have lost districts since the number of congressional seats has been set at 435 by statute .
1009,Also included here are non-voting delegations : six current and four obsolete .
1010,The boundaries of districts often shift with each redistricting .
1011,"Over time , the region and demographics represented in a district can change substantially ."
1012,"Furthermore , districts sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers ."

1017,"During the recording of the album , Carey began to deviate from her R & B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop ."
1018,"This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly ( 1997 ) , at which time Carey had separated from Mottola ."
1019,"Carey left Columbia in 2000 , and signed a record-breaking $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records ."
1020,"Before the release of her first feature film Glitter ( 2001 ) , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion ."
1021,"Following the film 's poor reception , she was bought out of her recording contract for $ 50 million , which led to a decline in her career ."

1033,Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus
1034,"In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body ."
1035,These suspended particles are also known as aerosols .
1036,Clouds in Earth 's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology .
1037,"Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated ; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air ."
1038,"In general , precipitation will fall to the surface ; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface ."
1039,"The international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous wisps , as in the case of cirrus ."
1040,Prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges .
1041,"These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers , cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds , nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation , alto- for middle clouds , and cirro- for high clouds ; the latter two of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure ."
1042,"Whether or not a cloud is low , middle , or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms ."
1043,Cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air .
1044,"Clouds in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system , which began to spread in popularity during December 1802 ."
1045,Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds .
1046,"While a majority of clouds form in Earth 's troposphere , there are occasions when clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed ."
1047,These three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere .
1048,"Above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere , which together make up the heterosphere that marks the transition to outer space ."
1049,"Clouds have been observed on other planets and moons within the Solar System , but , due to their different temperature characteristics , they are composed of other substances such as methane , ammonia , and sulfuric acid ."

1060,"Its twelve member institutions ( which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective states , well-regarded academically , and with relatively large student enrollment ) are located primarily in the Midwest , stretching from Nebraska in the west to Penn State in the east ."
1061,"The conference competes in the NCAA 's Division I ; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , formerly known as Division I-A , the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport ."
1062,"Member schools of the Big Ten ( or , in two cases , their parent university systems ) also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation , a leading educational and research consortium ."
1063,"Despite the conference 's name , the Big Ten actually consists of 12 schools , following the addition of The Pennsylvania State University in 1993 and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2011 ."
1064,"In 2014 , the conference will expand to 14 members with the additions of the University of Maryland , College Park and Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey ."
1065,"It is not to be confused with the Big 12 Conference , which has only ten schools and represents a different region of the country ."
1066,"Single Malt Scotch is single malt whisky made in Scotland using a pot still distillation process at a single distillery , with malted barley as the only grain ingredient ."
1067,"As with any Scotch whisky , a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years ( most single malts are matured longer ) ."
1068,`` Malt '' indicates that the whisky is distilled from a `` malted '' grain .
1069,"Several types of grains can be malted ( for example , barley , rye and wheat are all grains which can be malted ) ; however , in the case of single malt Scotch , barley is always the only grain used ."
1070,`` Single '' indicates that all the malts in the bottle come from a single distillery .
1071,Bottlings containing malt whisky from multiple distilleries are called `` blended malt `` .
1072,"Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 ( SWR 2009 ) , the word `` blended '' only appeared ( in the context of Scotch whisky ) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky , but this is no longer the case ."
1073,"Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009 , a `` blended malt Scotch whisky '' is a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies , not a mixture of malted barley whisky and non-barley whisky ; those are called `` blended Scotch whisky '' , without the word `` malt '' ."
1074,The term `` blended malt '' replaced `` vatted malt '' used under the prior labelling conventions .
1075,The age statement on a bottle of single malt Scotch is the number of years the whisky spent maturing in cask .
1076,As very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask the age statement reflects the age of the youngest malt in the mix .
1077,"A texture may be arranged so as to , `` closely approach the single-object status of fused-ensemble timbres , for example , the beautiful 'northern lights ' chord ... , in a very interesting distribution of pitches , produces a fused sound supported by a suspended cymbal roll `` ( Erickson ( 1975 ) , p.166 & 168 ) ."
1078,"In contrast to more traditional musical textures , sound mass composition `` minimizes the importance of individual pitches in preference for texture , timbre , and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact . ''"
1079,"Developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the late 1950s and 1960s , sound-mass `` obscures the boundary between sound and noise `` ( Edwards 2001 , pp . 326–27 ) ."
1080,"Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings , flutter tonguing , wide vibrato , extreme ranges , and glissandos ."
1081,"Composers and works include Barbara Kolb , Pauline Oliveros ' Sound Patterns for chorus ( 1961 ) , Norma Beecroft 's From Dreams of Brass for chorus ( 1963–1964 ) , and Nancy Van de Vate ."
1082,"Beecroft `` blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters , choral speech , narrator , and a wash of sounds from an electronic tape . ''"
1083,( ibid )
1084,"A very early example is the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel 's ballet Les Elémens ( 1737–38 ) , where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale ( Henck 2004 , pp . 52–54 ) ."
1085,A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger 's String Quartet 1931 ( Nonesuch H-71280 ) while more recently Phill Niblock 's multiple drone based music serves as an example .
1086,"The use of `` chords approaching timbres '' begins with Debussy and Edgard Varèse often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass ( Erickson 1975 , pp . 18 and 21 ) ."
1087,Other examples include European `` textural '' compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki 's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima ( 1959 ) and György Ligeti 's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosphères ( 1961 ) and his Requiem ( 1963-65 ) .
1088,"Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk Górecki , Karel Husa , Witold Lutosławski , Kazimierz Serocki , and Steven Stucky ."
1089,Sound mass techniques also appear in the music of George Crumb ( Anon . n.d. ) .

1099,Zealandia and Australia are both part of the wider regions known as Australasia and Oceania .
1100,"The continent of Australia lies on a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses — the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea , and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania ."
1101,"When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age , including the last glacial maximum about 18,000 BC , they were connected by dry land ."
1102,"During the past ten thousand years , rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today 's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania ."
1103,"Geologically , a continent extends to the edge of its continental shelf , so the now-separate islands are considered part of the continent ."
1104,"Due to the spread of animals , fungi and plants across the single Pleistocene landmass the separate lands have a related biota ."

1263,"Dredging is also used as a technique for fishing for certain species of edible clams and crabs , see fishing dredge ."
1264,"A dredger ( or “dredge” as is the general usage in the Americas ) is any device , machine , or vessel that is used to excavate and remove material from the bottom of a body of water ."
1265,"For example , a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up from the bottom of a pond is a dredger ."
1266,"Developing this idea further , a motorized crane equipped with a drag bucket or clamshell ( grabber ) that is used to scoop material from the bottom of a body of water is also a dredger ."
1267,"The crane could be located on the bank , or perhaps mounted on a barge ."

1331,"The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets , which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor ."
1332,Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) or platelet dysfunction .
1333,This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis .
1334,"In computer networking , a port is an application-specific or process-specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint in a computer 's host operating system ."
1335,"A port is associated with an IP address of the host , as well as the type of protocol used for communication ."
1336,The purpose of ports is to uniquely identify different applications or processes running on a single computer and thereby enable them to share a single physical connection to a packet-switched network like the Internet .
1337,"The protocols that primarily use ports are the Transport Layer protocols , such as the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) of the Internet Protocol Suite ."
1338,"A port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number , commonly known as the port number ."
1339,"The port number , added to a computer 's IP address , completes the destination address for a communications session ."
1340,"That is , data packets are routed across the network to a specific destination IP address , and then , upon reaching the destination computer , are further routed to the specific process bound to the destination port number ."
1341,Note that it is the combination of IP address and port number together that must be globally unique .
1342,"Thus , different IP addresses or protocols may use the same port number for communication ; e.g. , on a given host or interface UDP and TCP may use the same port number , or on a host with two interfaces , both addresses may be associated with a port having the same number ."
1343,"Of the thousands of enumerated ports , about 250 well-known ports are reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host ."
1344,"In the client-server model of application architecture , ports are used to provide a multiplexing service on each server-side port number that network clients connect to for service initiation , after which communication can be reestablished on other connection-specific port numbers ."
1345,"Area code 479 is the telephone area code serving thirteen counties in northwest Arkansas , including the cities of Fort Smith , Fayetteville , Springdale , Rogers and Bentonville : the second , third , fourth , eighth and tenth-largest cities in the state , respectively ."
1346,It was created in 2002 in a split from area code 501 .
1347,"Area code 479 serves Benton , Carroll ( split with area code 870 ) , Crawford , Franklin , Johnson , Logan , Madison , Polk , Pope , Scott , Sebastian , Washington and Yell Counties in Arkansas ."
1348,Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her .
1349,"In response to arraignment , the accused is expected to enter a plea ."
1350,"Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions , but they generally include `` guilty '' , `` not guilty '' , and the peremptory pleas ( or pleas in bar ) setting out reasons why a trial can not proceed ."
1351,Pleas of `` nolo contendere `` ( no contest ) and the `` Alford plea `` are allowed in some circumstances .
1352,"In England , Wales , Northern Ireland and Australia , arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial , and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment ."
1353,The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge .
1354,"In federal courts of the United States , arraignment takes place in two stages ."
1355,"The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual 's arrest , 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday ."
1356,During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel .
1357,"The presiding judge also decides at what amount , if any , to set bail ."
1358,"During the second arraignment , a post-indictment arraignment or PIA , the defendant is allowed to enter a plea ."
1359,"Geoffrey Chaucer ( ; c. 1343 – 25 October 1400 ) , known as the Father of English literature , is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to have been buried in Poet 's Corner of Westminster Abbey ."
1360,"While he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author , philosopher , alchemist and astronomer , composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for his ten year-old son Lewis , Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat , courtier and diplomat ."
1361,"Among his many works , which include The Book of the Duchess , the House of Fame , the Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde , he is best known today for The Canterbury Tales ."
1362,"Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of the vernacular , Middle English , at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin ."
1363,"The Chicago Blizzard of 1979 was a major blizzard that affected northern Illinois and northwest Indiana , U.S. on January 13 – January 14 , 1979 ."
1364,"of snow fell on January 13 alone , setting a new record for snow in one calendar day ."
1365,"By the end of January 14 , of snow had fallen ."
1366,The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L ' system .
1367,"Commuters crowded onto CTA buses , quickly overwhelming capacity , resulting in usual bus commutes of 30-45 minutes taking up to several hours ."
1368,"To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets , the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours , adding additional time to the commute ."
1369,Deployment of plows was significantly delayed and when they finally appeared they struggled to keep up with the snowfall .
1370,"Much of the snow remained unremoved throughout the next 2 months , causing ongoing public transit delays and significant problems with trash collection ."
1371,"The city 's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic , who had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J. Daley ."
1372,"Newspaper articles at the time blasted Bilandic ; Jane Byrne , Bilandic 's main political rival in the Democratic primary ( who had previously worked with Bilandic in the Daley administration and been fired by Bilandic when the two could not get along ) , capitalized on this and went on to defeat Bilandic in the February 27 primary ."
1373,"The 12-hour clock is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods : a.m. ( from the Latin ante meridiem , meaning `` before midday '' ) and p.m. ( post meridiem , `` after midday '' ) ."
1374,"Each period consists of 12 hours numbered : 12 ( acting as zero ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 ."
1375,The 12-hour clock was developed over time from the mid-second millennium BC to the 16th century AD .
1376,"Health spending per capita , in $ US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations ."
1377,"Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States are often made by government , public health and public policy analysts ."
1378,The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s .
1379,"The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada , on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP ."
1380,"In 2006 , per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US $ 3,678 ; in the U.S. , US $ 6,714 ."
1381,The U.S. spent 15.3 % of GDP on health care in that year ; Canada spent 10.0 % .
1382,"In 2006 , 70 % of health care spending in Canada was financed by government , versus 46 % in the United States ."
1383,"Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23 % higher than Canadian government spending , and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83 % of total Canadian spending ( public and private ) though these statistics do n't take into account population differences ."
1384,Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending .
1385,"A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States , but differences are not consistent . ''"
1386,"Life expectancy is longer in Canada , and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S. , but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences ."
1387,"One commonly cited comparison , the 2000 World Health Organization 's ratings of `` overall health service performance '' , which used a `` composite measure of achievement in the level of health , the distribution of health , the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution '' , ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations ."
1388,"This study rated the US `` responsiveness '' , or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment , as 1st , compared with 7th for Canada ."
1389,"While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US , simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior ."
1390,The WHO 's study methods were criticized by some analyses .
1391,"Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care , assuming the population makeup is similar , a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the `` difficult research issues '' facing international comparisons ."
1392,"Tarantulas comprise a group of often hairy and very large arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders , of which approximately 900 species have been identified ."
1393,"This article only describes members of Theraphosidae , although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as `` tarantulas '' ."

1398,"It can also be used as a measure of energy , for truck classification , or as a colloquial term ."
1399,"It is derived from the tun , the term applied to a barrel of the largest size ."
1400,"This could contain a volume between 210 and 256 gallons ( 800 to 1000 L ) , which could weigh around 2,000 pounds ( 900 kg ) and occupy some of space ."
1401,In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as ( avoirdupois pounds ) .
1402,"From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units , including the tonne ( metric ton ) , a non-SI metric unit defined as 1000 kg ."
1403,"The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms , including the ton and the term `` metric ton '' for `` tonne ''"
1404,In the United States and formerly Canada a ton is defined to be .
1405,"Where confusion is possible , the 2240 lb ton is called `` long ton `` and the 2000 lb ton `` short ton `` ; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling , but usually pronounced the same as ton , hence the US term `` metric ton '' ."
1406,"In the UK the final `` e '' of `` tonne '' can also be pronounced ( /ˈtʌnɪ/ ) , or `` metric ton '' when it is necessary to make the distinction ."
1407,"Where accuracy is required the correct term must be used , but for many purposes this is not necessary : the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6 % , and the short ton is within 11 % of both ."
1408,The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech .
1409,"The term `` ton '' is also used to refer to a number of units of volume , ranging from in capacity ."

1413,The Stanley Cup ( ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Finals .
1414,"Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston , then- Governor General of Canada , who awarded it to Canada 's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game ."
1415,The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC .
1416,"In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup ."
1417,"After a series of league mergers and folds , the Stanley `` Presentation Cup '' was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 ."
1418,"There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the `` Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup '' , the authenticated `` Presentation Cup '' , and the `` Replica Cup '' at the Hall of Fame ."
1419,The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks .
1420,"Nevertheless , the NHL does not actually own the trophy , but instead uses it by agreement with the two Trustees of the Cup ."
1421,"The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup , although the league 's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts ."
1422,"Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues of North America , a new Stanley Cup is not made each year ; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned ."
1423,"It is unusual among trophies , in that it has the names of all of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff engraved on its chalice ."
1424,"Initially , a new band added each year caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' ."
1425,In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band .
1426,"To avoid the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom ."
1427,"It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug ."
1428,"The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team ."
1429,The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres ( 7.28 inches ) in height and 29 centimetres ( 11.42 inches ) in diameter .
1430,"The current Stanley Cup , topped with a copy of the original bowl , is made of a silver and nickel alloy ; it has a height of 89.54 centimetres ( 35.25 inches ) and weighs 15.5 kilograms ( 34.5 lb / 2 st 61⁄2 lb ) ."
1431,"Since the 1914–15 season , the Cup has been won a combined 94 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams ."
1432,"Prior to that , the challenge cup was held by nine different teams ."
1433,The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last Canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993 .

1440,"In computer science , an integer is a datum of integral data type , a data type which represents some finite subset of the mathematical integers ."
1441,Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values .
1442,Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits .
1443,The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers .

1452,The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour .
1453,Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands .
1454,"However , damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems , and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife ."
1455,"Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( ) than fossil fuel powered energy plants ."

1542,"Earth is the third planet from the Sun , and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System ."
1543,It is also the largest of the Solar System 's four terrestrial planets .
1544,It is sometimes referred to as the world or the Blue Planet .
1545,"Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago , and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years ."
1546,"Earth 's biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions , which enabled the proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer , which together with Earth 's magnetic field blocked harmful solar radiation , and permitted formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land ."
1547,"The physical properties of the Earth , as well as its geological history and orbit , have allowed life to persist ."
1548,"Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from , to as long as ."
1549,"Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments , or tectonic plates , that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years ."
1550,"About 71 % of the surface is covered by salt water oceans , with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere ."
1551,Earth 's poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs .
1552,"The planet 's interior remains active , with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field , and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle ."
1553,"Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon ."
1554,"During one orbit around the Sun , the Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times , creating 365.26 solar days , or one sidereal year ."
1555,"The Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface with a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ) ."
1556,The Moon is Earth 's only natural satellite .
1557,It began orbiting the Earth about .
1558,"The Moon 's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides , stabilizes the axial tilt , and gradually slows the planet 's rotation ."
1559,"The planet is home to millions of species of life , including humans ."
1560,Both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population .
1561,"These inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states , which interact through diplomacy , travel , trade , and military action ."
1562,"Human cultures have developed many views of the planet , including its personification as a planetary deity , its shape as flat , its position as the center of the universe , and in the modern Gaia Principle , as a single , self-regulating organism in its own right ."
1563,"The Magician from the Waite-Smith tarot , who is depicted using the same tools that modern Wiccans use ."
1564,"In the neopagan religion of Wicca , a range of magical tools are used in ritual practice ."
1565,"Each of these tools has different uses and associations , and are used primarily to direct magical energies ."
1566,"They are used at an altar , inside a magic circle ."
1567,"In traditional Gardnerian Wicca , the tools are often divided into personal tools , which are for use by , and owned by , an individual Wiccan , and coven tools , used collectively by the coven ."
1568,"This practice may derive partly from Masonic traditions ( such as the use of the Square and Compasses ) , from which Wicca draws some material , and partly from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ."
1569,"The latter made much use of material from medieval grimoires such as the Key of Solomon , which has many illustrations of magical tools and instructions for their preparation ."
1570,Typical eukaryotic cell .
1571,"Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , and then release waste products ."
1572,"The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products ."
1573,Respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity .
1574,Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction .
1575,"The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body , most of which are redox reactions themselves ."
1576,"Although technically , cellular respiration is a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell ."
1577,This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps .
1578,"While the overall reaction is a combustion reaction , no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reaction ."
1579,"Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and a common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O2 ) ."
1580,"The energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy , including biosynthesis , locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes ."
1581,A stored-pressure fire extinguisher made by Amerex
1582,"A British fire extinguisher with ID sign , call point and fire action sign"
1583,"A fire extinguisher , flame extinguisher , or simply an extinguisher , is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires , often in emergency situations ."
1584,"It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire , such as one which has reached the ceiling , endangers the user ( i.e. , no escape route , smoke , explosion hazard , etc . ) , or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department ."
1585,"Typically , a fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire ."
1586,"In the United States , fire extinguishers , in all buildings other than houses , are generally required to be serviced and inspected by a Fire Protection service company at least annually ."
1587,Some jurisdictions require more frequent service for fire extinguishers .
1588,"The servicer places a tag on the extinguisher to indicate the type of service performed ( annual inspection , recharge , new fire extinguisher ) and when ."
1589,There are two main types of fire extinguishers : stored pressure and cartridge-operated .
1590,"In stored pressure units , the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself ."
1591,"Depending on the agent used , different propellants are used ."
1592,"With dry chemical extinguishers , nitrogen is typically used ; water and foam extinguishers typically use air ."
1593,Stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most common type .
1594,"Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge , exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent ."
1595,"This type is not as common , used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities , where they receive higher-than-average use ."
1596,"They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge , allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher , recharge it , and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time ."
1597,"Unlike stored pressure types , these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen , although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature ( -60 rated ) models ."
1598,"Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water , wetting agent , foam , dry chemical ( classes ABC and B.C . ) , and dry powder ( class D ) types in the rest of the world ."
1599,"Fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted , also called wheeled extinguishers ."
1600,"Handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms ( 1 to 30 pounds ) , and are hence , easily portable by hand ."
1601,Cart-mounted units typically weigh 23+ kilograms ( 50+ pounds ) .
1602,"These wheeled models are most commonly found at construction sites , airport runways , heliports , as well as docks and marinas ."
1603,"Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples in North America within the boundaries of the present-day continental United States , Alaska , and the island state of Hawaii ."
1604,"They are composed of numerous , distinct Native American tribes and ethnic groups , many of which survive as intact political communities ."
1605,The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been controversial .
1606,"According to a 1995 U.S. Census Census_Bureau Bureau Census_Bureau set of home interviews , most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as American Indians ( or simply Indians ) , and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups ; however , this term does not typically include Native Hawaiians or certain Alaskan Natives , such as Aleut , Yup'ik , or Inuit peoples ."
1607,"Since the end of the 15th century , the migration of Europeans to the Americas , and their importation of Africans as slaves , has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies ."
1608,Europeans created most of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the colonists ' immigration to the Americas .
1609,Many Native Americans lived as hunter-gatherer societies and told their histories by oral traditions .
1610,"In many groups , women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple crops : maize , beans and squash ."
1611,"The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the agrarian , proto-industrial , mostly Christian immigrants from western Eurasia ."
1612,"Many Native cultures were matrilineal ; the people occupied lands for use of the entire community , for hunting or agriculture ."
1613,Europeans at that time had patriarchal cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different .
1614,"The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans , as well as shifting alliances among different nations of each culture through the centuries , caused extensive political tension , ethnic violence and social disruption ."
1615,"The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with infectious Eurasian diseases , to which they had no acquired immunity ."
1616,Epidemics after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations .
1617,"Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of what today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly , ranging from 1 million to 18 million ."
1618,"After the colonies revolted against Great Britain and established the United States of America , President George Washington and Henry Knox conceived of the idea of `` civilizing '' Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as U.S. citizens ."
1619,"Assimilation ( whether voluntary as with the Choctaw , or forced ) became a consistent policy through American administrations ."
1620,"During the 19th century , the ideology of manifest destiny became integral to the American nationalist movement ."
1621,"Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands , warfare between the groups , and rising tensions ."
1622,"In 1830 , the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act , authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the Mississippi River , accommodating European-American expansion ."
1623,The first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers .
1624,There were also Jesuit missionaries active in the Northern Tier .
1625,"As United States expansion reached into the American West , settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the Great Basin , Great Plains , and other Western tribes ."
1626,These were complex nomadic cultures based on horse culture and seasonal bison hunting .
1627,"They carried out strong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the American Civil War , in a series of Indian Wars , which were frequent up until the 1890s , but continued into the 20th century ."
1628,The transcontinental railroad brought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west .
1629,"Over time , the U.S. forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes , and established reservations for them in many western states ."
1630,"U.S. agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits , but European-American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands ."
1631,"In 1924 , Native Americans who were not already U.S. citizens were granted citizenship by Congress ."
1632,"Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations , tribes , or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights ."
1633,Central America ( ) is the central geographic region of the Americas .
1634,"It is the southernmost , isthmian portion of the North American continent , which connects with South America on the southeast ."
1635,"When considered part of the unified continental model , it is considered a subcontinent ."

1664,The first applications were removing water from mines .
1665,In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotative motion .
1666,These 10 hp engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered .
1667,The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained .
1668,"By 1883 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible ."
1669,Steam engines could also be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives which are commonly just called steam engines outside America .
1670,"The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable ."
1671,Today steam turbines generate about 90 % of the electric power in the United States using a variety of heat sources .
1672,"Steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products ."
1673,"Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used ."
1674,The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle .
1675,"In the cycle , water is heated into steam in a boiler until it reaches a high pressure ."
1676,"When expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done ."
1677,The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler .
1678,"In general usage , the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants ( including boilers etc . ) such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines , or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone , as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine ."

1765,It is known as the `` City of Destiny '' because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century .
1766,"The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma 's neighboring deep-water harbor , Commencement Bay ."
1767,By connecting the bay with the railroad Tacoma 's motto became `` When rails meet sails . ''
1768,"Today Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma , a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington state 's largest port ."
1769,"Like most central cities , Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment ."
1770,"Since the 1990s , developments in the downtown core include the University of Washington Tacoma ; Tacoma Link , the first modern electric light rail service in the state ; the state 's highest density of art and history museums ; and a restored urban waterfront , the Thea Foss Waterway ."
1771,"With a long history of blue-collar labor politics — from the railroad workers of the 19th century , to the longshoremen of the 20th century , to the Labor Ready workers of today — Tacoma has long been known for its rough , gritty image ."
1772,"A song about Tacoma , `` Thrice All American '' , by American singer-songwriter and former resident Neko Case , describes it as `` a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound / where the factories churn / and the timber 's all cut down '' ."
1773,Tacoma-Pierce County has been named one of the most livable areas in the country .
1774,Tacoma was also recently listed as the 19th most walkable city in the country .
1775,"In contrast , the city is also ranked as the most stressed-out city in the country in a 2004 survey ."
1776,"In 2006 , women 's magazine Self named Tacoma the `` Most Sexually Healthy City '' in the United States ."
1777,"In 2012 , The Advocate gave Tacoma the title of `` Gayest City in America '' , in part because of the large diversity of public offices held , and Washington State passing a bill in 2012 allowing LGBT couples to marry ."
1778,Tacoma is famous for the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge .
1779,"Chula Vista ( ; ) is the second largest city in the San Diego metropolitan area , the seventh largest city in Southern California , the fourteenth largest city in the State of California , and the 77th-largest city in the United States ."
1780,"The population was 243,916 as of the 2010 census ."
1781,"Located just from downtown San Diego and from the Mexican border in the South Bay region of the metropolitan area , the city is at the center of one of the richest economic and culturally diverse zones in the United States ."
1782,Chula Vista is so named because of its scenic location between the San Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills .
1783,"Founded in the early 19th century , fast population growth has recently been observed in the city ."
1784,"As the second largest city in San Diego County , Chula Vista has quickly become a destination popular to many tourists ."
1785,"Located in the city is one of America 's few year-round United States Olympic Training centers and popular tourist destinations include Cricket Wireless Amphitheater , the Chula Vista marina , and the Chula Vista Nature Center ."
1786,"Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land , real property ( in contrast to personal property ) or real estate ."
1787,"The system has been used in England for many centuries , and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries ."
1788,"By custom , it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States , and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law ."
1789,"Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography , along with directions and distances , to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land ."
1790,"The boundaries are described in a running prose style , working around the parcel in sequence , from a point of beginning , returning back to the same point ; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds ."
1791,"It may include references to other adjoining parcels ( and their owners ) , and it , in turn , could also be referred to in later surveys ."
1792,"At the time the description is compiled , it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments ."
1793,"The term `` metes '' refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run , specified by a distance between the terminal points , and an orientation or direction ."
1794,"A direction may be a simple compass bearing , or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods ."
1795,"The term `` bounds '' refers to a more general boundary description , such as along a certain watercourse , a stone wall , an adjoining public road way , or an existing building ."
1796,"The system is often used to define larger pieces of property ( e.g . farms ) , and political subdivisions ( e.g . town boundaries ) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive , or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description ."
1797,Sir Isaac Newton ( 25 December 164220 March 1727 ) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution .
1798,"His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy '' ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics ."
1799,Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus .
1800,Newton 's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists ' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries .
1801,It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles .
1802,"By deriving Kepler 's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity , Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos ."
1803,Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum .
1804,He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
1805,"In addition to his work on the calculus , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , and developed Newton 's method for approximating the roots of a function ."
1806,Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge .
1807,"He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and , unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty , he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism ."
1808,"In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences , Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death ."
1809,"In his later life , Newton became president of the Royal Society ."
1810,He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint .
1811,Prof. Walter Lewin explains Newton 's law of gravitation in MIT course 8.01
1812,Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton 's law of gravitation
1813,Newton 's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them .
1814,( Separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers . )
1815,This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Newton called induction .
1816,"It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton 's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( `` the Principia '' ) , first published on 5 July 1687 ."
1817,"( When Newton 's book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society , Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him – see History section below . )"
1818,"In modern language , the law states the following:"
1819,"Assuming SI units , F is measured in newtons ( N ) , m1 and m2 in kilograms ( kg ) , r in meters ( m ) , and the constant G is approximately equal to ."
1820,"The value of the constant G was first accurately determined from the results of the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798 , although Cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for G ."
1821,This experiment was also the first test of Newton 's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory .
1822,"It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton 's Principia and 71 years after Newton 's death , so none of Newton 's calculations could use the value of G ; instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force ."
1823,"Newton 's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb 's law of electrical forces , which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between two charged bodies ."
1824,"Both are inverse-square laws , in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies ."
1825,"Coulomb 's Law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses , and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constant ."
1826,"Newton 's law has since been superseded by Einstein 's theory of general relativity , but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity ."
1827,"Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision , or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects ."
1828,"White and red flags , representing Iraqi and American deaths , sit in the grass quadrangle of The Valley Library on the Corvallis , Oregon , campus of Oregon State University ."
1829,"As part of the traveling Iraq Body Count exhibit from 2008 to 2009 ( not related to Iraq Body Count project ) , the flags aim to `` raise awareness of the human cost of the Iraq War . ''"
1830,( May 2008 )
1831,"Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( beginning with the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and continuing with the ensuing occupation of Iraq , as well as the activities of the various armed groups operating in the country ) have come in many forms , and the accuracy of the information available on different types of Iraq War casualties varies greatly ."
1832,The table below summarizes various estimates of the Iraqi casualty figures .
1833,"For troops in the U.S.-led multinational coalition , the death toll is carefully tracked and updated daily , and the names and photographs of those killed in action as well as in accidents have been published widely ."
1834,"A total of 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012 ."
1835,"Regarding the Iraqis , however , information on both military and civilian casualties is both less precise and less consistent ."
1836,"Estimates of casualty levels are available from reporters on the scene , from officials of involved organizations , and from groups that summarize information on incidents reported in the news media ."
1837,The word `` casualties `` in its most general sense includes the injured as well as the dead .
1838,"Accounts of the number of coalition wounded vary widely , partly because it is not obvious what should be counted : should only those injuries serious enough to put a soldier out of commission be included ?"
1839,"Do illnesses or injuries caused by accidents count , or should the focus be restricted to wounds caused by hostile engagement ?"
1840,"Sources using different definitions may arrive at very different numbers , and sometimes the precise definition is not clearly specified ."
1841,"Asalto al coche ( Robbery of the coach ) , by Francisco de Goya"
1842,A highwayman was a thief and brigand who preyed on travellers .
1843,"This type of outlaw usually travelled and robbed by horse , as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot ."
1844,Mounted robbers were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads .
1845,Such robbers operated in Great Britain and Ireland from the Elizabethan era until the early 19th century .
1846,The word highwayman is first known to be used in the year 1617 ; other euphemisms included `` knights of the road '' and `` gentlemen of the road . ''
1847,Two terms applied to 19th-century North American highwaymen were road agents in some instances for mountain bandits while in other cases the term is Rlallaala for mountain-based ruffians .

1863,Allium cells in different phases of the cell cycle
1864,The cells of eukaryotes ( left ) and prokaryotes ( right )
1865,"The cell is the basic structural , functional and biological unit of all known living organisms ."
1866,"It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing ( except virus , which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ) , and is often called the building block of life ."
1867,"It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane , which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids ."
1868,Organisms can be classified as unicellular ( consisting of a single cell ; including most bacteria ) or multicellular ( including plants and animals ) .
1869,"While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species , Humans contain about 100 trillion ( 1014 ) cells ."
1870,Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope .
1871,The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 .
1872,"The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells , that all cells come from preexisting cells , that vital functions of an organism occur within cells , and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells ."
1873,Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago .
1874,"The word cell comes from the Latin cella , meaning `` small room '' ."
1875,The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in .

1881,"While it is common for the term headlight to be used interchangeably in informal discussion , headlamp is the term for the device itself , while headlight properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device ."
1882,"Other vehicles , such as trains and aircraft , are required to have headlamps ."
1883,"Bicycle headlamps are often used on bicycles , and are required in some jurisdictions ."

1912,"Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the NHL , over the past four plus decades the percentages of US and European players have increased both because of the NHL 's continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967 , and the increased availability of highly skilled European players ."
1913,Maggots feeding on carrion .
1914,"A maggot is the larva of a fly ( order Diptera ) ; it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachyceran flies , such as houseflies , cheese flies , and blowflies , rather than larvae of the Nematocera , such as mosquitoes and Crane flies ."
1915,`` Maggot '' is not a technical term and should not be taken as such ; in many standard textbooks of entomology it does not appear in the index at all .
1916,In many non-technical texts the term is used for insect larvae in general .
1917,Other sources have coined their own definitions ; for example : `` ...
1918,The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared ... '' and `` ... Applied to the footless larvae of Dipters . ''

2317,The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data .
2318,"With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early '80s , the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s , and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged ."
2319,Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications .
2320,The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil ( as part of the electronic discovery process ) courts .
2321,Forensics may also feature in the private sector ; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation ( a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion ) .

2323,"The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure , forensic imaging ( acquisition ) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence ."
2324,"As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime , digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects , confirm alibis or statements , determine intent , identify sources ( for example , in copyright cases ) , or authenticate documents ."

2326,A comparison of the chromaticities enclosed by some color spaces .
2327,"A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers , typically as three or four values or color components ( e.g . RGB and CMYK are color models ) ."
2328,"However , a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation ."
2329,Adding a certain mapping function between the color model and a certain reference color space results in a definite `` footprint '' within the reference color space .
2330,"This `` footprint '' is known as a gamut , and , in combination with the color model , defines a new color space ."
2331,"For example , Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces , both based on the RGB model ."
2332,"In the most generic sense of the definition above , color spaces can be defined without the use of a color model ."

2338,"The policy holder typically pays a premium , either regularly or as a lump sum ."
2339,Other expenses ( such as funeral expenses ) are also sometimes included in the benefits .

2341,"Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer ; common examples are claims relating to suicide , fraud , war , riot and civil commotion ."
2342,Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:
2343,"Protection policies – designed to provide a benefit in the event of specified event , typically a lump sum payment ."
2344,A common form of this design is term insurance .
2345,Investment policies – where the main objective is to facilitate the growth of capital by regular or single premiums .

2450,The `` Betsy Ross '' flag
2451,A `` Betsy Ross '' flag flying outside San Francisco City Hall
2452,"The Betsy Ross flag is an early design of the flag of the United States , popularly attributed to Betsy Ross , using the common motifs of alternating red-and-white striped field with five-pointed stars in a blue canton ."
2453,The flag was designed during the American Revolution and features 13 stars to represent the original 13 colonies .
2454,The distinctive feature of the Ross flag is the arrangement of the stars in a circle .
2455,"Although the Betsy Ross story is accepted by most Americans , some flag historians and revisionists do not accept the Betsy Ross design as the first American flag ."
2456,"According to the traditional account , the original flag was made in June 1776 , when a small committee—including George Washington , Robert Morris and relative George Ross —visited Betsy and discussed the need for a new American flag ."
2457,"Betsy accepted the job to manufacture the flag , altering the committee 's design by replacing the six-pointed stars with five-pointed stars ."
2458,"While the Betsy Ross legend is questionable , the flag design is known to have been in use by 1777 ; Alfred B . Street described it at the surrender of General Burgoyne and understood the circle of stars to represent equality among the American states ."
2459,"It is one of the oldest versions of U.S. flags known to exist ; while it is not the oldest surviving flag artifact in cloth form , its likeness appears on older physical relics , namely , the contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale ."
2460,"They depict the circular star arrangement being flown from ship masts and many other places , and thus provide the first known historical documentation of the flag 's appearance ."
2461,The seal of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs uses the Betsy Ross flag to represent service to all veterans from the American Revolution to the present day .

2467,"Other animals that have been said to purr are rabbits , squirrels , guinea pigs , tapirs , ring-tailed lemurs , elephants , raccoons and gorillas while eating ."
2468,"However , using a strict definition of purring that continuous sound production must alternate between pulmonic egressive and ingressive airstream ( and usually go on for minutes ) , Peters ( 2002 ) , in an exhaustive review of the scientific literature , reached the conclusion that until then only ‘purring cats’ ( Felidae ) and two species of genets , Genetta tigrina , and most likely also Genetta genetta , had been documented to purr ."

2561,"The crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers ( Italy , France , Germany , the British Empire , the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia ) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high ."

2563,The more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans .
2564,Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
2565,"Although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between the various European powers since 1870 ."

2571,"In attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war ."
2572,"Early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War '' were shown to be incomplete and biased ."
2573,"In addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between Russia and France , were found to have been doctored ."

2862,"The standard common law test of criminal liability is usually expressed in the Latin phrase , actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea , which means `` the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty '' ."
2863,"Thus , in jurisdictions with due process , there must be an actus reus , or `` guilty act , '' accompanied by some level of mens rea to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged ( see the technical requirement of concurrence ) ."
2864,"As a general rule , criminal liability does not attach to a person who acted with the absence of mental fault ."
2865,The exception is strict liability crimes .
2866,"In civil law , it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort , for example ."
2867,"However , if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached , such intent may increase the scope of liability as well as the measure of damages payable to the plaintiff ."
2868,"Therefore , mens rea refers to the mental element of the offence that accompanies the actus reus ."
2869,"In some jurisdictions , the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology ."
2870,"In Australia , for example , the elements of the federal offences are now designated as `` fault elements '' or `` mental elements '' ( mens rea ) and `` physical elements '' or `` external elements '' ( actus reus ) ."
2871,This terminology was adopted to replace the obscurity of the Latin terms with simple and accurate phrasing .
2872,"Ulysses S. Grant ( born Hiram Ulysses Grant ; April 27 , 1822 – July 23 , 1885 ) was the 18th President of the United States ( 1869–1877 ) following his highly successful role as a war general in the second half of the Civil War ."
2873,"Under Grant , the Union Army defeated the Confederate military ; having effectively ended the war and secession with the surrender of Robert E. Lee 's army at Appomattox ."
2874,As president he led the Radical Republicans in their effort to eliminate all vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery .
2875,"Upset over uncontrolled violence in the South and having desired to protect African American citizenship , President Grant effectively destroyed the Ku Klux Klan in 1871 ."
2876,Grant was the first President to establish Civil Service reform having created a two-year federally funded Civil Service Commission in 1871 .
2877,"In terms of foreign policy , Grant revealed an `` unexpected capacity for deliberation and consultation '' that promoted the national interest ."
2878,"His reputation was marred by his repeated defense of corrupt appointees , and by America 's first industrial age economic depression ( called the `` Panic of 1873 `` ) that dominated his second term ."
2879,"Although his Republican Party split in 1872 with reformers denouncing him , Grant was easily reelected ."
2880,By 1875 the conservative white Southern opposition regained control of every state in the South and as he left the White House in March 1877 his policies were being undone .
2881,"A career soldier , he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and served in the Mexican–American War ."
2882,"When the Civil War began in 1861 , Grant trained Union volunteer regiments in Illinois ."

2884,"He then led Union forces to victory after initial setbacks in the Battle of Shiloh , earning a reputation as an aggressive commander ."
2885,"In July 1863 , after a long , complex campaign , Grant defeated five uncoordinated Confederate armies ( capturing one of them ) and seized Vicksburg ."
2886,"This famous victory gave the Union full control of the Mississippi River , split off the western Confederacy , and opened the way for more Union triumphs ."
2887,"After another win at the Battle of Chattanooga in late 1863 , President Abraham Lincoln made him lieutenant general and commander of all of the Union Armies ."
2888,"As commanding general of the army , Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of very bloody battles in 1864 known as the Overland Campaign that ended with the bottling up of Lee at Petersburg , outside the Confederate capital of Richmond ."
2889,"During the siege , Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns launched by William Tecumseh Sherman , Philip Sheridan , and George Thomas ."
2890,"Finally breaking through Lee 's trenches , the Union Army captured Richmond in April 1865 ."
2891,Lee surrendered his depleted forces to Grant at Appomattox as the Confederacy collapsed .
2892,"Although pro-Confederate historians attacked Grant as a ruthless butcher who won by brute force , most historians have hailed his military genius ."
2893,Grant 's two consecutive terms as President stabilized the nation after the American Civil War and during the turbulent Reconstruction period that followed .
2894,"As president , he enforced Reconstruction by enforcing civil rights laws and fighting Ku Klux Klan violence ."
2895,Grant won passage of the Fifteenth Amendment ; giving constitutional protection for African-American voting rights .
2896,"He used the army to build the Republican Party in the South , based on black voters , Northern newcomers ( `` Carpetbaggers `` ) and native white supporters ( `` Scalawags . '' )"
2897,"As a result , African Americans were represented in the U.S. Congress for the first time in American history in 1870 ."
2898,"Reformers praised Grant 's Indian peace policy by having broken the deadlock on Indian appropriations in Congress , the creation of the Board of Indian Commissioners to make reform recommendations , and his enlistment of Quaker Protestants who controlled mid western Indian agencies , that effectively curbed Congressional patronage ."
2899,Grant remained determined in keeping Indians from being exterminated from white settler encroachment or by the U.S. military .
2900,"Grant 's reputation as president by 1875 was at an all-time high for his previous veto of the Inflation Bill , the passage of the Resumption of Specie Act , and Secretary Bristow 's successful raids that shut down the Whiskey Ring ."
2901,"Grant 's foreign policy , led by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , implemented International Arbitration , settled the Alabama Claims with Britain and avoided war with Spain over the Virginius Affair ."
2902,"A jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device , usually a coin-operated machine , that will play a patron 's selection from self-contained media ."
2903,"The classic jukebox has buttons with letters and numbers on them that , when entered in combination , are used to play a specific selection ."
2904,"A drug test is a technical analysis of a biological specimen – for example urine , hair , blood , sweat , or oral fluid / saliva – to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites ."
2905,"Major uses of drug testing are to detect the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport or for drugs prohibited by laws , such as cannabis , cocaine and heroin ."

2918,Space exploration is the discovery and exploration of outer space by means of space technology .
2919,Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft .
2920,"While the observation of objects in space , known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality ."
2921,"Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research , uniting different nations , ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries ."
2922,Various criticisms of space exploration are sometimes made .
2923,Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War .
2924,"The early era of space exploration was driven by a `` Space Race `` between the Soviet Union and the United States , the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth , the USSR 's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957 , and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as the boundaries for this initial period ."
2925,"The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones , including the first living being in orbit in 1957 , the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961 , the first spacewalk ( by Aleksei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965 , the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 , and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971 ."
2926,"After the first 20 years of exploration , focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware , such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station ( ISS ) ."
2927,"With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011 , plans for space exploration by the USA remain in flux ."
2928,"Constellation , a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009 ."
2929,"The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low earth orbit ( LEO ) , envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020 , transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector , and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO , such as Earth/Moon L1 , the Moon , Earth/Sun L2 , near-earth asteroids , and Phobos or Mars orbit ."
2930,"As of March 2011 , the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards a compromise NASA funding bill , which will probably terminate Constellation and fund development of a heavy lift launch vehicle ( HLLV ) ."
2931,"In the 2000s , the People 's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program , while the European Union , Japan , and India have also planned future manned space missions ."
2932,"China , Russia , Japan , and India have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century , while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century ."
2933,"From the 1990s onwards , private interests began promoting space tourism and then private space exploration of the Moon ( see Google Lunar X Prize ) ."
2934,"John Calvin Coolidge , Jr. ( July 4 , 1872January 5 , 1933 ) was the 30th President of the United States ( 1923–1929 ) ."
2935,"A Republican lawyer from Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of that state ."
2936,His conduct during the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action .
2937,"Soon after , he was elected as the 29th Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 ."
2938,"Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative , and also as a man who said very little ."
2939,"Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity ."
2940,"As a Coolidge biographer put it , `` He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions ."
2941,That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . ''
2942,Some later criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of laissez-faire government .
2943,"His reputation underwent a renaissance during the Ronald Reagan Administration , but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government programs and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating and controlling the economy ."
2944,Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans .
2945,"Espresso often has a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods , a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids , and crema ( meaning cream , but being a reference to the foam with a creamy texture that forms as a result of the pressure ) ."
2946,As a result of the pressurized brewing process the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated .
2947,"Espresso is the base for other drinks , such as a latte , cappuccino , macchiato , mocha , or americano ."
2948,"Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most beverages , but the usual serving size is smaller—a typical 60 mL ( 2 US fluid ounce ) of espresso has 80 to 150 mg of caffeine , little less than the 95 to 200 mg of a standard 240 mL ( 8 US fluid ounces ) cup of drip-brewed coffee ."
2949,"Brian Keith Kelly ( born October 25 , 1961 ) is an American football coach and former player ."
2950,"He is currently the head football coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish , a position he has held since December 2009 ."
2951,"Kelly was previously head coach at Grand Valley State University ( 1991–2003 ) , Central Michigan University ( 2004–2006 ) , and University of Cincinnati ( 2006–2009 ) ."
2952,"Sidney Patrick Crosby , ONS ( born August 7 , 1987 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) ."
2953,Crosby was drafted first overall by the Penguins out of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) .
2954,"During his two-year major junior career with the Rimouski Océanic , he earned back-to-back CHL Player of the Year awards and led his club to the 2005 Memorial Cup final ."
2955,"Nicknamed `` The Next One `` , he was one of the most highly regarded draft picks in hockey history , leading many to refer to the 2005 Draft Lottery as the `` Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes '' ."
2956,"In his first NHL season , Crosby finished sixth in league scoring with 102 points ( 39 goals , 63 assists ) and was a runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy ( won by Alexander Ovechkin ) ."
2957,"By his second season , he led the NHL with 120 points ( 36 goals , 84 assists ) to capture the Art Ross Trophy , becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring title in any major North American sports league ."
2958,"That same season , Crosby also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the Professional Hockey Writers Association 's choice for most valuable player and the Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL Players Association 's choice for most outstanding player , becoming the seventh player in NHL history to earn all three awards in one year ."
2959,"Crosby started the 2007–08 season with the team 's captaincy and subsequently led them to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals , where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games ."
2960,The Penguins returned to the Finals against Detroit the following year and won in seven games ; Crosby became the youngest captain in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup .
2961,"In the 2009–10 season , Crosby scored a career-high 51 goals , tying him with Steven Stamkos for the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league-leader ; with 58 assists , he totaled 109 points , second in the NHL ."
2962,"During the off-season , Crosby received the Mark Messier Leadership Award ."
2963,"In 2010–11 , Crosby sustained a concussion as a result of hits to the head in back-to-back games ."
2964,The injury left him sidelined for ten and a half months .
2965,"However , after playing eight games in the 2011–12 season , Crosby 's concussion-like symptoms returned in December 2011 , and he did not return until mid-March 2012 ."
2966,"Internationally , Crosby has represented Canada in numerous tournaments for the country 's junior and men 's teams ."
2967,"After competing in the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup , he represented Canada in back-to-back IIHF World U20 Championships , winning silver in 2004 and gold in 2005 ."
2968,"At the 2006 IIHF World Championship , he led the tournament in scoring , while also earning Top Forward and All-Star Team honours ."
2969,"Four years later , Crosby was named to Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver ."
2970,"Playing the United States in the gold medal game , he scored the game-winning goal in overtime ."
2971,"A United States cent , also known as a penny ."
2972,"`` My two cents '' ( 2¢ ) and its longer version `` put my two cents in '' is an United States ( US ) idiomatic expression , taken from the original English idiom expression : to put in `` my two pennies worth '' or `` my tuppence worth . ''"
2973,It is used to preface the tentative stating of one’s opinion .
2974,"By deprecating the opinion to follow – suggesting its value is only two cents , a very small amount – the user of the phrase hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly statement , showing politeness and humility ."
2975,"However , it is also sometimes used with irony when expressing a strongly felt opinion ."
2976,The phrase is also used out of habit to preface uncontentious opinions .
2977,For example:
2978,The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the government of the Republic of China led by the Kuomintang ( KMT ) and forces of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) .
2979,"The war began in April 1927 , amidst the Northern Expedition , and essentially ended when major active battles ceased in 1950 ."
2980,"The conflict eventually resulted in two de facto states , the Republic of China ( ROC ) in Taiwan and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in mainland China , both claiming to be the legitimate government of China ."
2981,"The war represented an ideological split ( Left vs . Right ) between the Communist CPC , and the KMT 's brand of Nationalism ."
2982,"The civil war continued intermittently until late 1937 , when the two parties formed a Second United Front to counter a Japanese invasion ."
2983,"China 's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946 , a year after the end of hostilities with Japan ."
2984,"After four more years , 1950 saw the cessation of major military hostilities—with the newly founded People 's Republic of China controlling mainland China ( including Hainan ) , and the Republic of China 's jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan , Penghu , Quemoy , Matsu and several outlying islands ."
2985,"The Kuomintang defeat is attributed to several factors : Corruption - Chiang wrote in his diary on June 1948 that the KMT had failed , not because of external enemies but because of rot from within ."
2986,"Strong initial support from the U.S. diminished , and then , stopped ."
2987,"( Partly because of KMT corruption and anti-democratic regime , and partly because of the uncertain U.S. foreign policy towards Communism between 1945 and 1950 ) ; Communist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords ."
2988,This ensured PLA popular support .
2989,"After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II , Soviet forces turned over their captured Japanese weapons to the CPC and allowed the CPC to take control of territory in Manchuria ."
2990,"To this day , no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed , and it is debated as to the whether the Civil War has legally ended ."
2991,"Cross-Strait relations have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure , particularly over Taiwan 's political status , with both governments officially adhering to a `` One-China policy . ''"
2992,The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the Republic of Taiwan .
2993,"The ROC mutually claims mainland China , and they both continue the fight over diplomatic recognition ."
2994,"Today , the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the form of cross-Strait relations ; however , the two separate de facto states have close economic ties ."
2995,"The One Hundred Twelfth United States Congress was the meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government , from January 3 , 2011 until January 3 , 2013 ."
2996,"It convened in Washington , D.C. on January 3 , 2011 , and ended on January 3 , 2013 , 17 days before the end of the presidential term to which Barack Obama was elected in 2008 ."
2997,Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress .
2998,This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census .
2999,"In the 2010 midterm elections , the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives ."
3000,"While the Democrats kept their Senate majority , it was reduced from the previous Congress ."
3001,"This was the first Congress in which the House and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress ( 2001–2003 ) , and the first Congress to begin that way since the 99th Congress ( 1985–1987 ) ."
3002,"In this Congress , the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members , 242 , since the 80th Congress ( 1947–1949 ) ."
3003,"It was also the first Congress since 1947 in which no member of the Kennedy family served , as well as the most politically polarized Congress since Reconstruction , with record low approval ratings ."
3004,"Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities ."
3005,"The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1945–2009 , unadjusted for inflation or population change ."
3006,"For example , a household in possession of an $ 800,000 house , $ 5,000 in mutual funds , $ 30,000 in cars , $ 20,000 worth of stock in their own company , and a $ 45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $ 900,000 ."
3007,"Assuming that this household would have a $ 250,000 mortgage , $ 40,000 in car loans , and $ 10,000 in credit card debt , its debts would total $ 300,000 ."
3008,"Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household 's assets ( 900,000 - $ 300,000 = $ 600,000 ) , this household would have a net worth of $ 600,000 ."
3009,Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets .
3010,"The wealth —more specifically , the median net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race , education , geographic location and gender ."
3011,"As one would expect , households with greater income feature the highest net worths , though high income can not be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth ."
3012,"Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise , with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers ."
3013,"In addition , wealth is unevenly distributed , with the wealthiest 25 % of US households owning 87 % of the wealth in the United States , which was $ 54.2 trillion in 2009 ."
3014,"Including human capital such as skills , the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $ 118 trillion ."
3015,"This article deals with Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) rather than the rhizotomy procedures for pain relief ; for those procedures , which have begun to take the name `` rhizotomy '' in certain instances , see facet rhizotomy and similar ."
3016,"A rhizotomy ( ) is a term chiefly referring to a neurosurgical procedure that selectively destroys problematic nerve roots in the spinal cord , most often to relieve the symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy ."
3017,"The selective dorsal rhizotomy ( SDR ) for spastic cerebral palsy has been the main use of rhizotomy for neurosurgeons specialising in spastic CP since the 1980s ; in this surgery , the spasticity-causing nerves are isolated and then targeted and destroyed ."
3018,"The sensory nerve roots , where spasticity is located , are first separated from the motor ones , and the nerve fibres to be cut are then identified via electromyographic stimulation ."
3019,The ones producing spasticity are then selectively lesioned with tiny electrical pulses .
3020,"In spasticity , rhizotomy precisely targets and destroys the damaged nerves that don’t receive gamma amino butyric acid , which is the core problem for people with spastic cerebral palsy ."
3021,"These over-firing , non-GABA-absorbing nerves generate unusual electrical activity during the EMG testing phase in SDR and are thus considered to be the source of the patient 's hypertonia ; they are eliminated with the electrical pulses once identified , while the remaining nerves and nerve routes carrying the correct messages remain fully intact and untouched ."
3022,"This means that the spasticity is permanently dissolved , and that this is done without affecting nervous system sensitivity or function in other areas , because the only nerves destroyed are the over-firing ones responsible for the muscle tightness ."
3023,The terms rhizotomy and neurotomy are also increasingly becoming interchangeable in the treatment of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease .
3024,This is a procedure called a facet rhizotomy and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing nerve root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body .
3025,Such radio frequency nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed .
3026,"A facet rhizotomy is just one of many different forms of radiofrequency ablation , and its use of the `` rhizotomy '' name should not be confused with the SDR procedure ."
3027,"Migrant workers in California , 1935"
3028,The term migrant worker has different official meanings and connotations in different parts of the world .
3029,"The United Nations ' definition is broad , including any people working outside of their home country ."
3030,"The term can also be used to describe someone who migrates within a country , possibly their own , in order to pursue work such as seasonal work ."
3031,Photograph of Lil Wayne with teardrop tattoos below his eyes .
3032,The teardrop tattoo or tear tattoo is a symbolic tattoo that is placed underneath the eye .
3033,It has no fixed meaning but almost all meanings ( see below ) have some connection to prison .
3034,U.S. Route 75 is a north–south U.S. Highway .
3035,"The highway 's northern terminus is in Kittson County , Minnesota , at the Canadian border , where it once continued as Manitoba Highway 75 on the other side of the now-closed border crossing ."
3036,"Its southern terminus is at Interstate 30 and Interstate 45 in Dallas , Texas , where it is known as North Central Expressway ."
3037,"U.S. 75 was a border-to-border route , from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston , Texas ."
3038,"However , the entire segment south of Dallas , Texas has been decommissioned in favor of Interstate 45 , a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become State Highway 75 ."
3039,Lower Ninth Ward is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans .
3040,"As the name implies , it is part of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans ."
3041,"The Lower Ninth Ward is often thought of as the entire area within New Orleans downriver of the Industrial Canal ; however , the City Planning Commission divides this area into the Lower Ninth Ward ( 2 ) and Holy Cross ( 3 ) neighborhoods ."
3042,"The term `` Lower '' refers to its location farther towards the mouth of the Mississippi River , `` down '' or `` below '' the rest of the city in local geographic terminology ."
3043,"But the 9th Ward , like all Wards in New Orleans , is a voting district ."
3044,The 9th Ward was added as a voting district in 1852 .
3045,"The `` lower '' 9th Ward is composed of Ward 9 Districts 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 which make up the Holy Cross Area and Ward 9 Districts 3 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ."
3046,Higher voting district numbers in the 9th Ward ( 8-27 ) are on the upriver side of the Industrial Canal .
3047,The area came to national attention for its devastation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
3048,"Hubble views of Copernicus crater ( inset ) , which is about 58 miles ( 93 km ) wide"
3049,"Red and orange tinted Moon , as seen from Earth during a lunar eclipse , where the Earth comes between the Moon and Sun"
3050,"The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth , and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System ."
3051,"It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27 % the diameter and 60 % the density of Earth , resulting in its mass ."
3052,"The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter ."
3053,"The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters ."
3054,"It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark , with a reflectance similar to that of coal ."
3055,"Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have , since ancient times , made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology ."
3056,The Moon 's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day .
3057,"The Moon 's current orbital distance , about thirty times the diameter of the Earth , causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun , allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses ."
3058,This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence .
3059,"The Moon 's linear distance from the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82±0.07cm per year , but this rate is not constant ."
3060,"The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago , not long after the Earth ."
3061,"Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past , the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars -sized body ."
3062,The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot .
3063,"The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the United States ' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date , beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968 , and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 , with the first being Apollo 11 ."
3064,"These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon 's origins , the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history ."
3065,"After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 , the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft , notably by the final Soviet Lunokhod rover ."
3066,"Since 2004 , Japan , China , India , the United States , and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters ."
3067,These spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith .
3068,"Future manned missions to the Moon have been planned , including government as well as privately funded efforts ."
3069,"The Moon remains , under the Outer Space Treaty , free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes ."
3070,"Ronald Wilson Reagan ( ; February 6 , 1911 – June 5 , 2004 ) was the 40th President of the United States ( 1981–1989 ) ."
3071,"Prior to that , he was the 33rd Governor of California ( 1967–1975 ) , and a radio , film and television actor ."
3072,"Born in Tampico , Illinois , and raised in Dixon , Reagan was educated at Eureka College , earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology ."
3073,"After graduating , Reagan moved first to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then , in 1937 , to Los Angeles where he began a career as an actor , first in films and later television ."
3074,"Some of his most notable films include Knute Rockne , All American ( 1940 ) , Kings Row ( 1942 ) , and Bedtime for Bonzo ( 1951 ) ."
3075,Reagan served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and later as a spokesman for General Electric ( GE ) ; his start in politics occurred during his work for GE .
3076,"Originally a member of the Democratic Party , his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s , and he switched to the Republican Party in 1962 ."
3077,"After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater 's presidential candidacy in 1964 , he was persuaded to seek the California governorship , winning two years later and again in 1970 ."
3078,"He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976 , but won both the nomination and general election in 1980 , defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter ."
3079,"As president , Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives ."
3080,"His supply-side economic policies , dubbed `` Reaganomics `` , advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth , controlling the money supply to reduce inflation , deregulation of the economy , and reducing government spending ."
3081,"In his first term he survived an assassination attempt , took a hard line against labor unions , announced a new War on Drugs , and ordered an invasion of Grenada ."
3082,"He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 , proclaiming that it was `` Morning in America `` ."
3083,"His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters , such as the ending of the Cold War , the 1986 bombing of Libya , and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair ."
3084,"Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire `` , he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of détente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR ."
3085,"Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of both countries ' nuclear arsenals ."
3086,Reagan left office in 1989 .
3087,"In 1994 , the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease earlier in the year ; he died ten years later at the age of 93 ."
3088,"A conservative icon , he ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American political right ."
3089,"Complete set of scrolls , constituting the entire Tanakh ."
3090,"The Tanakh ( , or ; also Tenakh , Tenak , Tanach ) is a name used in Judaism for the canon of the Hebrew Bible ."
3091,The Tanakh is also known as the Masoretic Text or the Miqra .
3092,"The name is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the Masoretic Text 's three traditional subdivisions : The Torah ( `` Teaching '' , also known as the Five Books of Moses ) , Nevi'im ( `` Prophets '' ) and Ketuvim ( `` Writings '' ) —hence TaNaKh ."
3093,"The name `` Miqra '' ( מקרא ) , meaning `` that which is read '' , is an alternative Hebrew term for the Tanakh ."
3094,"The books of the Tanakh were relayed with an accompanying oral tradition passed on by each generation , called the Oral Torah ."

3096,"It was introduced in 1995 , and has been constantly updated throughout the years in response to new products from Honda , Suzuki , and Yamaha ."
3097,The ZX series is what was known as the Ninja line of Kawasaki motorcycles in the 1980s and still carries the name today .
3098,"Assassination attempts and plots on Presidents of the United States have been numerous : more than 20 attempts to kill sitting and former presidents , as well as the Presidents-elect , are known ."
3099,"Four sitting presidents have been killed : Abraham Lincoln ( the 16th President ) , James A. Garfield ( the 20th President ) , William McKinley ( the 25th President ) and John F. Kennedy ( the 35th President ) ."
3100,"Two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations : former President Theodore Roosevelt ( the 26th President ) , and President Ronald Reagan ( the 40th President ) ."
3101,"Although the historian J.W . Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations were politically motivated actions , carried out by rational men , not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons ."
3102,"Some attackers had questionable mental stability , and a few were judged legally insane ."
3103,"Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century been elected from the same political party as the President , the assassination of the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes ."
3104,This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks .

3108,"The state 's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma , meaning `` red people '' , and it is known informally by its nickname , The Sooner State ."
3109,"Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16 , 1907 , Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union ."
3110,"Its residents are known as Oklahomans or , informally `` Okies '' , and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City ."
3111,"A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agriculture , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology ."
3112,"It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation , ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth ."
3113,"Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas ."
3114,"With small mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S . Interior Highlands —a region especially prone to severe weather ."
3115,"In addition to having a prevalence of English , German , Scottish , Irish and Native American ancestry , more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma , second only to California ."
3116,"Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans ."
3117,"Redwall , by Brian Jacques , is a series of children 's fantasy novels ."
3118,"It is the title of the first book of the series , published in 1986 , as well as the name of the Abbey featured in the book and the name of an animated TV series based on three of the novels ( Redwall , Mattimeo , and Martin the Warrior ) , which first aired in 1999 ."
3119,"The books are primarily aimed at older children , but have fans of all ages ."

3121,"The twenty-second , and final , novel , The Rogue Crew , was posthumously released on May 3 , 2011 ."
3122,Natural Gas is usually measured by volume in the United States and is stated in cubic feet .
3123,"A cubic foot of gas is the amount of gas needed to fill a volume of one cubic foot under set conditions of pressure and temperature.To measure larger amounts of natural gas , a `` therm '' is used to denote 100 cubic feet , and `` mcf '' is used to denote 1,000 cubic feet ."
3124,"To provide greater accuracy in comparing fuels , energy content is measured in terms of `` British Thermal Units ( BTU 's ) . ''"
3125,"A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water ( approximately a pint ) , one degree Fahrenheit at or close to its point of maximum density ."
3126,"One British therm ( symbol thm ) is a non- SI unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units ( BTU ) ."
3127,It is approximately the energy equivalent of burning 100 cubic feet ( often referred to as 1 CCF ) of natural gas .
3128,"Since ( Natural Gas ) meters measure volume and not energy content , a therm factor is used by ( Natural ) gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent , and thus calculate the actual energy use ."
3129,The therm factor is usually in the units therms/CCF .
3130,It will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas .
3131,"Natural gas with a higher than average concentration of ethane , propane or butane will have a higher therm factor ."
3132,"Impurities , such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen , lower the therm factor ."
3133,The volume of the gas is calculated as if measured at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) .
3134,"The heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas , and is independent of temperature and pressure ."
3135,"One therm is equal to about 105.5 megajoules , 25,200 kilocalories or 29.3 kilowatt-hours ."
3136,One therm can also be provided by about of natural gas .
3137,The therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie ( see below ) .
3138,The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat .
3139,"A thermie ( th ) is a metric unit of heat energy , part of the meter-tonne-second system sometimes used by European engineers ."
3140,The thermie is equal to the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 tonne of water by 1 °C .
3141,"The thermie is equivalent to 1,000 kilocalories , 4.1868 megajoules or 3968.3 BTU ."

3149,"Escherichia coli ( ; commonly abbreviated E. coli ) is a Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms ( endotherms ) ."
3150,"Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in humans , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination ."
3151,"The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2 , and by preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine ."
3152,"E. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1 % of gut flora , and fecal–oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease ."
3153,"Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time , which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination ."
3154,"There is , however , a growing body of research that has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside of the host ."
3155,"The bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting , and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years ."
3156,"E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism , and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology , where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA ."
3157,Area code 217 is the North American telephone area code for much of western and central Illinois .
3158,"The 217 area includes Illinois ' capital , Springfield , plus Champaign , Urbana , Decatur , Danville , Quincy , and Rantoul ."
3159,"217 was one of the original area codes , which were created in 1947 ."
3160,"The only significant change in 217 's boundaries was in 1957 , when its northern portion was combined with part of area code 815 to form area code 309 ."
3161,"Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever recorded ( September 2006 ) , over the Southern pole"
3162,Layers of the atmosphere ( not to scale )
3163,"Ozone depletion describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since the late 1970s : a steady decline of about 4 % per decade in the total volume of ozone in Earth 's stratosphere ( the ozone layer ) , and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth 's polar regions ."
3164,The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole .
3165,"In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena , there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events ."
3166,"The details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude thinning , but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens ."
3167,"The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants ( CFCs , freons , halons ) ."
3168,These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface .
3169,Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halo-carbons increased .
3170,CFCs and other contributory substances are referred to as ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ) .
3171,"Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths ( 280–315 nm ) of ultraviolet light ( UV light ) from passing through the Earth 's atmosphere , observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol that bans the production of CFCs , halons , and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane ."
3172,"It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences such as increases in skin cancer , cataracts , damage to plants , and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean 's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion ."
3173,The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution 's fundamental purposes and guiding principles .
3174,"It states in general terms , and courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of , the Founding Fathers ' intentions regarding the Constitution 's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve as it pertains to all of the people of the United States ."
3175,"As the phrase , `` we the people '' suggests that the new government originates from the people of the United States and it sets into motion a question as it pertains to that vast population concerning the individual rights and equality among all people ; this can be seen most broadly in the divide between republicanism and social democracy ."

3177,The shot put ( pronounced ) is a track and field event involving `` throwing '' / '' putting '' ( throwing in a pushing motion ) a heavy spherical object —the shot—as far as possible .
3178,"The shot put competition for men has been a part of the modern Olympics since their revival in 1896 , women 's competition began in 1948 ."
3179,"Map of the United Nations ( UN ) member states , with their territories ( including dependent territories ) recognized by the UN in blue"
3180,"There are United Nations ( UN ) member states , and each of them is a member of the United Nations General Assembly ."
3181,"The criteria for admission of new members are set out in the United Nations Charter , Chapter II , Article 4:"
3182,"A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council 's fifteen members , with none of the five permanent members voting against ."
3183,The Security Council 's recommendation must then be subsequently approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote .
3184,"In principle , only sovereign states can become UN members , and currently all UN members are sovereign states ( although a few members were not sovereign when they joined the UN ) ."
3185,"Because a state can only be admitted to the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly , a number of states that may be considered sovereign states according to the Montevideo Convention criteria are not members because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty , mainly due to the lack of international recognition or opposition from certain members ."
3186,"In addition to the member states , the UN also invites non-member states ( currently two : the Holy See and Palestine ) , intergovernmental organizations , and other international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty are not precisely defined , to become observers at the General Assembly , allowing them to participate and speak , but not vote , in General Assembly meetings ."
3187,"The Eiffel Tower ( , ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris , named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower ."
3188,"Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World 's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world ."
3189,The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011 .
3190,"The third level observatory 's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the highest in Europe as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower , at , remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000 ."
3191,The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010 .
3192,"The tower stands tall , about the same height as an 81-storey building ."
3193,"During its construction , the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years , until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930 ."
3194,"Because of the addition , in 1957 , of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower , it is now taller than the Chrysler Building ."
3195,"Not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in France , after the Millau Viaduct ."
3196,The tower has three levels for visitors .
3197,"Tickets can be purchased to ascend , by stairs or lift ( elevator ) , to the first and second levels ."
3198,"The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps , as is the walk from the first to the second level ."
3199,The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public .
3200,The first and second levels have restaurants .
3201,"The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France , often in the establishing shot of films set in the city ."

3219,The Canadian Football League or CFL ( ' [ LCF ] in French ) is a professional sports league located in Canada .
3220,"The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football , a form of gridiron football closely related to American football ."
3221,"Its eight current teams , which are located in eight separate cities , are divided into two divisions of four teams each — the East Division and the West Division ."
3222,The league 's 19-week regular season runs from late June to early November ; each team plays 18 games with one bye week .
3223,"Following the regular season , the three teams with the best records in their division ( except if the fourth place team in one division has a better record than the third place team in the other division , when the team with the better record makes the playoffs and `` crosses over '' to the other division 's playoff ) compete in the league 's three-week divisional playoffs , which culminate in the late-November Grey Cup championship , the country 's largest annual sports and television event ."
3224,"The CFL was officially founded on January 19 , 1958 , making it the second oldest gridiron football league in North America still in operation , although all its teams long predate the modern formation of the league ."
3225,"It is the highest level of play in Canadian football , the most popular football league in Canada , and the second-most popular major sports league in Canada , after the National Hockey League ."
3226,"Although ice hockey is Canada 's most popular sport , the CFL has increased the popularity of Canadian football in Quebec and Western Canada ."
3227,"Canadian football is also played at amateur levels ( i.e . youth , high school , CJFL , QJFL , CIS and senior leagues such as the Alberta Football League ) ."
3228,"The 2010s will be a significant decade for the CFL in terms of growth , as teams have renovated , expanded stadiums , or plan to build entirely new stadiums ."
3229,"The Montreal Alouettes accomplished this first , adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in time for the 2010 CFL season ."
3230,The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated their respective stadiums and facilities for the 2010 season .
3231,"In 2011 , the BC Lions played under a new , retractable roof in BC Place after spending one and a half seasons at Empire Field ."
3232,"Then the Winnipeg Blue Bombers will play in an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba , scheduled to open in time for the 2013 season ."
3233,"The Hamilton Tiger-Cats , Saskatchewan Roughriders and the new Ottawa franchise are also looking at new or extensively-renovated stadiums in the following years ."
3234,"There are also hopes of expanding the league to Atlantic Canada ( ideally basing a team in either the more populated Halifax , or the more centralized Moncton ) , as 2010 and 2011 had regular season games hosted in Moncton ."
3235,"According to sports historian Douglas Brei , the Canadian Football League holds the distinction of being the only professional sports league in North America , major or minor league , in which each existing franchise has won at least one league title while in their current location ."
3236,Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key .
3237,"An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses ."
3238,"The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen ."
3239,"Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision ."
3240,"Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) ."
3241,The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
3242,Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .
3243,"Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor ( BCR ) ."
3244,"The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure ."
3245,"In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding ."
3246,"Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms ."
3247,Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably .
3248,Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .
3249,"There are several different types of antibody heavy chains , and several different kinds of antibodies , which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess ."
3250,"Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals , which perform different roles , and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter ."
3251,"Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist ."
3252,This region is known as the hypervariable region .
3253,Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .
3254,This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
3255,"The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity ."
3256,"Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region ."
3257,This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system .
3258,The symbol used by the Zodiac Killer to sign his correspondence
3259,The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
3260,The killer 's identity remains unknown .
3261,"The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia , Vallejo , Lake Berryessa , and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969 ."
3262,Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted .
3263,The killer originated the name `` Zodiac '' in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press .
3264,These letters included four cryptograms ( or ciphers ) .
3265,"Of the four cryptograms sent , only one has been definitively solved ."
3266,"Suspects have been named by law enforcement and amateur investigators , but no conclusive evidence has surfaced ."
3267,"In April 2004 , the San Francisco Police Department marked the case `` inactive '' , yet re-opened the case at some point prior to March 2007 ."
3268,"The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo , as well as in Napa County and Solano County ."
3269,The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969 .
3270,"Jennings is a small city in and the parish seat of Jefferson Davis Parish , Louisiana , United States , near Lake Charles ."
3271,"The population was 10,383 at the 2010 census , a small decline from the 2000 tabulation ."
3272,The city is 68 percent white .
3273,"Jennings is the principal city of the Jennings Micropolitan Statistical Area , which includes all of Jefferson Davis Parish ."
3274,It is also part of the larger Lake Charles-Jennings Combined Statistical Area .
3275,Nanotechnology ( sometimes shortened to `` nanotech '' ) is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale .
3276,"The earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology ."
3277,"A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers ."
3278,"This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold ."
3279,It is therefore common to see the plural form `` nanotechnologies '' as well as `` nanoscale technologies '' to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size .
3280,"Because of the variety of potential applications ( including industrial and military ) , governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research ."
3281,"Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative , the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars ."
3282,The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars .
3283,"Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , microfabrication , etc ."
3284,"The associated research and applications are equally diverse , ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly , from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale ."
3285,Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology .
3286,"Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications , such as in medicine , electronics , biomaterials and energy production ."
3287,"On the other hand , nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology , including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on global economics , as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios ."
3288,These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .
3289,Map of the Eastern Bloc
3290,"The term Eastern Bloc or Communist Bloc refers to the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe , generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact ."
3291,"The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union , although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe ."
3292,"The New Jersey gubernatorial election of 2009 took place on November 3 , 2009 ."
3293,"Democratic Governor Jon Corzine was running for a second term and was being challenged by Republican Chris Christie , Independent Christopher Daggett and nine others , in addition to several write-in candidates ."
3294,"Christie won the election , with about 48.5 percent of the vote , to 44.9 percent for Corzine and 5.8 percent for Daggett ."
3295,Christie won the largest margin for a first term Republican since 1969 .
3296,"Christie assumed office on January 19 , 2010 ."
3297,This was the first election to fill the newly created office of Lieutenant Governor .
3298,"The candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were joined together as a single choice , so that voters did not have the opportunity to split the ticket ."
3299,"Kim Guadagno , Christie 's running mate , became New Jersey 's first lieutenant governor following her inauguration ."
3300,Health care in the United States is provided by many distinct organizations .
3301,Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses .
3302,Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government .
3303,"60-65 % of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare , Medicaid , TRICARE , the Children 's Health Insurance Program , and the Veterans Health Administration ."
3304,"Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member 's employer , some buy health insurance on their own , and the remainder are uninsured ."
3305,"Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in 2013 , the United States was at or near the bottom in infant mortality , heart and lung disease , sexually transmitted infections , adolescent pregnancies , injuries , homicides , and rates of disability ."
3306,"Together , such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the list for life expectancy ."
3307,"On average , a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country ."
3308,"According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United States spent more on health care per capita ( $ 7,146 ) , and more on health care as percentage of its GDP ( 15.2 % ) , than any other nation in 2008 ."
3309,"The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries , and notes U.S. care costs the most ."
3310,"The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 49.9 million residents , 16.3 % of the population , were uninsured in 2010 ( up from 49.0 million residents , 16.1 % of the population , in 2009 ) ."
3311,A 2004 Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report said : `` The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its population . ''
3312,"A 2004 OECD report said : `` With the exception of Mexico , Turkey , and the United States , all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal ( at least 98.4 % insured ) coverage of their populations by 1990 . ''"
3313,"A 2010 report observed that lack of health insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States ."
3314,"In 2007 , 62.1 % of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses ."
3315,"A 2013 study found that about 25 % of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses , and 43 % are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence ."
3316,"On March 23 , 2010 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) became law , providing for major changes in health insurance ."
3317,"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body ."
3318,A significant fraction of the human body is water .
3319,"Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight ."
3320,"In a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life ."
3321,"Also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' ."
3322,"These figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology ."
3323,"So there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure ."
3324,"For example , Jackson 's ( 1985 ) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates Guyton 's 57 % ."
3325,"In diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem ."
3326,"Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide ."
3327,"Per Netter 's Atlas of Human Physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments:"
3328,Intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .
3329,"Per Guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb ."
3330,Jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .
3331,Extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .
3332,"Per Guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % Again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here ."
3333,Plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .
3334,"Per Guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres ."
3335,"This amounts to 20 % , the same as per Netter 's Atlas ."
3336,Interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
3337,"Transcellular fluid ( a.k.a . `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )"
3338,"Contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids ."
3339,Self-esteem is a term used in psychology to reflect a person 's overall emotional evaluation of his or her own worth .
3340,It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self .
3341,"Self-esteem encompasses beliefs ( for example , `` I am competent , '' `` I am worthy '' ) and emotions such as triumph , despair , pride and shame ."
3342,"Smith and Mackie define it by saying `` The self-concept is what we think about the self ; self-esteem , is the positive or negative evaluations of the self , as in how we feel about it . ''"
3343,"Self-esteem is also known as the evaluative dimension of the self that includes feelings of worthiness , prides and discouragement ."
3344,One 's self-esteem is also closely associated with self-consciousness .
3345,Self-esteem is a disposition that a person has which represents their judgements of their own worthiness .
3346,"In the mid-1960s , Morris Rosenberg and social-learning theorists defined self-esteem as a personal worth or worthiness ."
3347,Nathaniel Branden in 1969 defined self-esteem as `` the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness . ''
3348,"According to Branden , self-esteem is the sum of self-confidence ( a feeling of personal capacity ) and self-respect ( a feeling of personal worth ) ."
3349,"It exists as a consequence of the implicit judgement that every person has of their ability to face life 's challenges , to understand and solve problems , and their right to achieve happiness , and be given respect ."
3350,"As a social psychological construct , self-esteem is attractive because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of relevant outcomes , such as academic achievement ( Marsh 1990 ) or exercise behavior ( Hagger et al . 1998 ) ."
3351,"In addition , self-esteem has also been treated as an important outcome due to its close relation with psychological well-being ( Marsh 1989 ) ."
3352,"Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension ( for example , `` I believe I am a good writer and I feel happy about that '' ) or a global extent ( for example , `` I believe I am a bad person , and feel bad about myself in general '' ) ."
3353,"Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic ( `` trait '' self-esteem ) , though normal , short-term variations ( `` state '' self-esteem ) also exist ."
3354,"Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include : self-worth , self-regard , self-respect , and self-integrity ."
3355,"A Masonic Lodge , often termed a Private Lodge or Constituent Lodge , is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry ."
3356,"Every new Lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge , but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published Constitution of the jurisdiction ."
3357,"By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world 's first known Grand Lodge in London ( today called the United Grand Lodge of England ) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial i.e . without such warrant ; only one other lodge operates without a warrant - this is the Grand Stewards ' Lodge in London , although it is not also entitled to the `` time immemorial '' title ."
3358,"A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge , in any jurisdiction ( i.e . under any Grand Lodge ) in amity with his own ."
3359,"In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons ( that is , Freemasons who have attained the Order 's third degree ) ."
3360,"He is first usually required to check , and certify , the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge - and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership ."
3361,"Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice , Fellowcraft and Master Mason ."
3362,"Pilkington Group Limited is a multinational glass manufacturing company headquartered in St Helens , United Kingdom and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japan-based NSG Group ."
3363,Prior to its acquisition by NSG in 2006 it was an independent company listed on the London Stock Exchange and for a time was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index .
3364,"A quotation is the repetition of one expression as part of another one , particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source , and it is indicated by ( punctuated with ) quotation marks ."
3365,"A quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression , especially parts of artistic works : elements of a painting , scenes from a movie or sections from a musical composition ."
3366,Year 1877 ( MDCCCLXXVII ) was a common year starting on Monday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Saturday of the 12-day slower Julian calendar .
3367,"Black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning ."
3368,"The fruit , known as a peppercorn when dried , is approximately in diameter , dark red when fully mature , and , like all drupes , contains a single seed ."
3369,"Peppercorns , and the ground pepper derived from them , may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper ( cooked and dried unripe fruit ) , green pepper ( dried unripe fruit ) and white pepper ( dried ripe seeds ) ."
3370,"Black pepper is native to south India , and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions ."
3371,"Currently Vietnam is the world 's largest producer and exporter of pepper , producing 34 % of the world 's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008 ."
3372,Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavour and as a medicine .
3373,Black pepper is the world 's most traded spice .
3374,It is one of the most common spices added to European cuisine and its descendants .
3375,"The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine , not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs ."
3376,"It is in the modern world , often paired with salt ."
3377,"Fire hydrant in Charlottesville , Virginia , USA"
3378,"A fire hydrant ( also known colloquially as a fire plug in the United States or as a johnny pump in New York City ) , is an active fire protection measure , and a source of water provided in most urban , suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire ."
3379,Buildings near a hydrant may qualify for an insurance discount since firefighters should be able to more rapidly extinguish a fire on the insured property .
3380,The concept of fire plugs dates to at least the 17th century .
3381,This was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight fires .
3382,"The water would fill the hole creating a temporary well , and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or , later , by hand-pumped fire engines ."
3383,"The holes were then plugged with stoppers , normally redwood , which over time came to be known as fire plugs ."
3384,The location of the plug would often be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future fires .
3385,This is the source of the colloquial term fire plug still used for fire hydrants today .
3386,"After the Great Fire of London in 1666 , the city installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals , equipped with risers , allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street level ."
3387,"The invention of a post- or pillar-type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr. , Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801 ."
3388,It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of `` wet barrel '' design with the valve in the top .
3389,"It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant , but this can not be verified because the patent office in Washington D.C. caught on fire in 1836 destroying many patent records from that period in the process ."
3390,The President of the Republic of South Africa is the head of state and head of government under South Africa 's Constitution .
3391,"From 1961 to 1994 , the head of state was called the State President ."
3392,"The President is elected by members of the National Assembly , the lower house of Parliament , and is usually the leader of the largest party , which has been the African National Congress since the first non-racial elections were held on 27 April 1994 ."
3393,"The role was originally founded to be distinct from the now defunct role of prime minister , but the two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which specified a four-year term of office ."
3394,The 1993 and later constitutions limits the president 's time in office to two five-year terms .
3395,"The first President to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela , and the incumbent president is Jacob Zuma ."
3396,"Under the interim Constitution ( valid from 1994 to 1996 ) , there was a Government of National Unity , in which an MP from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as Deputy President ."
3397,"Along with Thabo Mbeki , the last State President , F.W . De Klerk also served as Deputy President , in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new Parliament ."
3398,But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party .
3399,"A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution ( adopted in 1996 ) , although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president ."
3400,Special education or special needs education is the education of students with special needs in a way that addresses the students ' individual differences and needs .
3401,"Ideally , this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures , adapted equipment and materials , accessible settings , and other interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and community than would be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education ."
3402,"Common special needs include challenges with learning , communication challenges , emotional and behavioral disorders , physical disabilities , and developmental disorders ."
3403,"Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching , use of technology , a specifically adapted teaching area , or resource room ."
3404,"Intellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs , but the term `` special education '' is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students whose special needs reduce their ability to learn independently or in an ordinary classroom , and gifted education is handled separately ."
3405,"In most developed countries , educators are modifying teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments ."
3406,"Special education in developed countries is often regarded less as a `` place '' and more as `` a range of services , available in every school . ''"
3407,Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students .
3408,The opposite of special education is general education .
3409,General education is the standard curriculum presented with standard teaching methods and without additional supports .
3410,"George Soros ( or ; ; ; born August 12 , 1930 , as Schwartz György ) is a Hungarian-American business magnate , investor , and philanthropist ."
3411,He is the chairman of Soros Fund Management .
3412,Soros supports progressive-liberal causes .
3413,He is known as `` The Man Who Broke the Bank of England `` because of his in investment profits during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis .
3414,"Between 1979 and 2011 , Soros gave away over $ 8 billion to human rights , public health , and education causes ."
3415,He played a significant role in the peaceful transition from communism to capitalism in Hungary ( 1984–89 ) and provided one of Europe 's largest higher education endowments to Central European University in Budapest .
3416,Soros is also the chairman of the Open Society Institute .
3417,An actor portraying Alexander Graham Bell speaking into an early model telephone .
3418,"The invention of the telephone is the culmination of work done by many individuals , the history of which involves a collection of claims and counterclaims ."
3419,The development of the modern electrical telephone involved an array of lawsuits founded upon the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies .
3420,"This article covers the early years from 1844 to 1898 , from conception of the idea of an electric voice-transmission device , to failed attempts to use `` make-and-break '' current , to successful experiments with electromagnetic telephones by Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson , and finally to commercially successful telephones in the late 19th century ."
3421,"A Master of Fine Arts ( MFA , M.F.A . ) is a graduate degree typically requiring 2–3 years of postgraduate study beyond the bachelor 's degree ( BFA ) , although the term of study will vary by country or by university ."
3422,"The MFA is a creative degree usually awarded as a terminal degree in visual arts , creative writing , filmmaking , dance , or theatre and other performing arts ."
3423,Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a major work or performance .
3424,"Master of Fine Arts programs have generally required a bachelor 's degree prior to admission , but many do not require that the undergraduate major be the same as the MFA field of study ."
3425,The most important admissions requirement has often been a sample portfolio or a performance audition .
3426,"The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA , while an academic program , centers around practice in the particular field , whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly , academic , or critical study of the field ."
3427,"Additionally , in the United States , an MFA is recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of Visual Art , Design , Dance , Theatre , Film/Video , New Media , and Creative Writing - meaning that it is considered to be the highest degree in its field , and is used as a minimum qualification to be able to apply to become a Full-Time Professor teaching at the University level in these disciplines ."
3428,"There are exceptions to this standard in the Arts , notably in the case of music performance , where the MFA is not seen as a terminal degree in the context of the more standardized DMA degree ."
3429,"It is also critical to note that in the interest of extending the connection between creative production and continued academic research , some universities have established practice-based Ph.D programs in fields such as creative writing , visual arts , new media , design and theater ."
3430,"While this has had an effect in Creative Writing , and to a lesser extent in design and new media , the influx of graduates from practice-based PhD programs has not appreciably changed the standard for the MFA as the terminal degree in most Arts disciplines yet ."
3431,"This is an ongoing contentious topic , and is the frequent subject of academic panels , especially at the annual College Art Association conference ."
3432,The CAA 2008 guidelines regarding the MFA strongly re-affirms that the PhD is not required as a terminal degree in the visual arts .
3433,The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945 .
3434,The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date .
3435,"Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities , the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan ."
3436,"The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May , but the Pacific War continued ."
3437,"Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945 , threatening Japan with `` prompt and utter destruction '' ."
3438,"The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum , and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project ."
3439,"American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 , followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August ."
3440,"Within the first two to four months of the bombings , the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki , with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day ."
3441,"The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that , of the people who died on the day of the explosion , 60 % died from flash or flame burns , 30 % from falling debris and 10 % from other causes ."
3442,"During the following months , large numbers died from the effect of burns , radiation sickness , and other injuries , compounded by illness ."
3443,"In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death , 15–20 % died from radiation sickness , 20–30 % from burns , and 50–60 % from other injuries , compounded by illness ."
3444,"In both cities , most of the dead were civilians , although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison ."
3445,"On 15 August , six days after the bombing of Nagasaki , Japan announced its surrender to the Allies , signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September , officially ending World War II ."
3446,"The bombings led , in part , to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament ."
3447,The role of the bombings in Japan 's surrender and their ethical justification are still debated .
3448,"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948 ) , commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi , was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India ."
3449,"Employing non-violent civil disobedience , Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence , civil rights and freedom across the world ."
3450,"The son of a senior government official , Gandhi was born and raised in a Hindu Bania community in coastal Gujarat , and trained in law in London ."
3451,"Gandhi became famous by fighting for the civil rights of Muslim and Hindu Indians in South Africa , using new techniques of non-violent civil disobedience that he developed ."
3452,"Returning to India in 1915 , he set about organising peasants to protest excessive land-taxes ."
3453,A lifelong opponent of `` communalism `` ( i.e . basing politics on religion ) he reached out widely to all religious groups .
3454,He became a leader of Muslims protesting the declining status of the Caliphate .
3455,"Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 , Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , increasing economic self-reliance , and above all for achieving Swaraj —the independence of India from British domination ."
3456,"Gandhi led Indians in protesting the national salt tax with the Dandi Salt March in 1930 , and later in demanding the British to immediately Quit India in 1942 , during World War II ."
3457,He was imprisoned for that and for numerous other political offenses over the years .
3458,"Gandhi sought to practice non-violence and truth in all situations , and advocated that others do the same ."
3459,He saw the villages as the core of the true India and promoted self-sufficiency ; he did not support the industrialization programs of his disciple Jawaharlal Nehru .
3460,"He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl , woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha ."
3461,"His chief political enemy in Britain was Winston Churchill , who ridiculed him as a `` half-naked fakir . ''"
3462,"He was a dedicated vegetarian , and undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and political mobilization ."
3463,"In his last year , unhappy at the partition of India , Gandhi worked to stop the carnage between Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs that raged in the border area between India and Pakistan ."
3464,He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India 's Muslims .
3465,30 January is observed as Martyrs ' Day in India .
3466,The honorific Mahatma ( `` Great Soul '' ) was applied to him by 1914 .
3467,In India he was also called Bapu ( `` Father '' ) .
3468,"He is known in India as the Father of the Nation ; his birthday , 2 October , is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti , a national holiday , and world-wide as the International Day of Non-Violence ."
3469,"Gandhi 's philosophy was not theoretical but one of pragmatism , that is , practicing his principles in the moment ."
3470,"Asked to give a message to the people , he would respond , `` My life is my message . ''"
3471,"Joan Crawford ( March 23 , ca . 1904 – May 10 , 1977 ) , born Lucille Fay LeSueur , was an American actress in film , television and theatre ."
3472,"Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway , Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925 ."
3473,"Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts , Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a flapper by the end of the 1920s ."
3474,"In the 1930s , Crawford 's fame rivaled , and later outlasted , MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo ."
3475,Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success .
3476,These `` rags-to-riches '' stories were well received by Depression -era audiences and were popular with women .
3477,"Crawford became one of Hollywood 's most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States , but her films began losing money and by the end of the 1930s she was labeled `` box office poison '' ."

3516,"Events involving meiosis , showing chromosomal crossover"
3517,Meiosis ( ) is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes .
3518,The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores .
3519,"In many organisms , including all animals and land plants ( but not some other groups such as fungi ) , gametes are called sperm and egg cells ."
3520,"Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-cycle ' cell division process of mitosis , it differs in two important respects:"
3521,"the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete , compared with the co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome ( one received from each parent ) in each cell which results from mitosis ."
3522,"the outcome of meiosis is potentially four ( genetically unique ) haploid cells , compared with the two ( genetically identical ) diploid cells produced from mitosis ."
3523,Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome —one from the organism 's mother and one from its father .
3524,"The cell divides twice , potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome ."
3525,"( `` Potentially '' because in some cases , such as the formation of oocytes in mammals , only one of the possible four haploid cells survives . )"
3526,In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete .
3527,"Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA , resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent ."
3528,This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations .
3529,"This genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes ( phenotypes ) upon which natural selection can act , but , as described below in Section 6 , Origin and function of meiosis , the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosis ."
3530,"It is also noteworthy that during meiosis , specific genes are more highly transcribed , and these are called the meiome , the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome ."
3531,"Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing , synapse and recombination occur ."
3532,"In addition to strong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA ( the meiome ) , however , there are also pervasive translational controls ( e.g . selective usage of preformed mRNA ) , regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of genes during meiosis ."
3533,"Thus , both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosis ."
3534,"Prior to the meiosis process the cell 's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication , creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome ( homologs ) two exact copies , sister chromatids , attached at the centromere region ."
3535,In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other .
3536,Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosome .
3537,Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator .
3538,Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell .
3539,"As the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells , each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids ."
3540,"After the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells , a second round of cell division occurs ."
3541,There meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells .
3542,"Upon fertilization , for example when a sperm enters an egg cell , two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse ."
3543,The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offspring 's genome .
3544,"Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis , a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells ."
3545,In all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores : haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization .
3546,"Boxing ( pugilism , prize fighting , the sweet science or in Greek pygmachia ) is a martial art and combat sport in which two people engage in a contest of strength , speed , reflexes , endurance and will by throwing punches with gloved hands ."
3547,Amateur boxing is an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most of the major international games - it also has its own World Championships .
3548,Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds .
3549,"The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee , is disqualified for breaking a rule , resigns by throwing in a towel , or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest ."
3550,The birth hour of boxing as a sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game as early as 688 BC .
3551,"Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century , again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States ."
3552,"In 2004 , ESPN ranked boxing as the most difficult sport in the world ."
3553,Agreement or concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates .
3554,"It is an instance of inflection , and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category ( such as gender or person ) `` agree '' between different words or parts of the sentence ."
3555,"For example , in Standard English , one may say I am or he is , but not `` I is '' or `` he am '' ."
3556,This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its subject agree in person .
3557,"The pronouns I and he are first and third person respectively , as are the verb forms am and is ."
3558,The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject .
3559,"The agreement based on overt grammatical categories as above is formal agreement , in contrast to notional agreement , which is based on meaning ."
3560,"For instance , the phrase The United States is treated as singular for purposes of agreement , even though it is formally plural ."

3669,"Its winter fur is long and bushy , and predominantly a mottled gray in colour , although nearly pure white , red , or brown to black also occur ."
3670,"Within the genus Canis , the gray wolf represents a more specialised and progressive form than its smaller cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ) , as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey , its more gregarious nature and its highly advanced expressive behavior ."
3671,"It is a social animal , travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring ."
3672,"The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range , with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it ."
3673,"It feeds primarily on large ungulates , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage ."
3674,"The gray wolf is one of the world 's most well researched animals , with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species ."
3675,"It has a long history of association with humans , having been despised and hunted in most agricultural communities due to its attacks on livestock , while conversely being respected by some Native American tribes ."
3676,"It is the sole ancestor of the dog , which was first domesticated in the Middle East ."
3677,"Although the fear of wolves is prevalent in many human societies , the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies ."
3678,"Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people , mainly children , but this is unusual , as wolves are relatively few , live away from people , and have been taught to fear humans by hunters and shepherds ."
3679,"Hunting and trapping has reduced the species ' range to , though its still relatively widespread range and stable population means that the species is not threatened at a global level , and is therefore classified by the IUCN as Least Concern ."

3697,"Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public schools , state-certified private schools , or an approved home school program ."
3698,"In most public and private schools , education is divided into three levels : elementary school , middle school ( sometimes called junior high school ) , and high school ( sometimes referred to as secondary education ) ."
3699,"In almost all schools at these levels , children are divided by age groups into grades , ranging from kindergarten ( followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school , up to twelfth grade , the final year of high school ."
3700,The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area .
3701,"Post-secondary education , better known as `` college `` in the United States , is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system , and is described in a separate section below ."
3702,"Government supported , free public schools for all started being established after the revolution , and expanded in the 19th century , as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann and Booker T. Washington ."

3714,"The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier , and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of sound , ( Mach 1.4 ) ."
3715,"Since the source is moving faster ( with a speed ) than the sound waves it creates , it actually leads the advancing wavefront ."
3716,The sound source will pass by a stationary observer ( with a speed ) before the observer actually hears the sound it creates .
3717,"As a result , an observer in front of the source will detect"
3718,and an observer behind the source .
3719,"A sonic boom produced by an aircraft moving at M=2.92 , calculated from the cone angle of 20 degrees ."

3741,"Radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data , for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects ."
3742,The tags contain electronically stored information .
3743,Some tags are powered and read at short ranges ( a few meters ) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ) .
3744,"Others use a local power source such as a battery , or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field , and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves ( i.e. , electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies ) ."
3745,Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters .
3746,"Unlike a bar code , the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader , and may be embedded in the tracked object ."
3747,RFID tags are used in many industries .
3748,An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line .
3749,Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses .

3752,"Id , ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud 's structural model of the psyche ; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described ."
3753,"According to this model of the psyche , the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends ; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role ; and the ego is the organized , realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego ."
3754,The super-ego can stop you from doing certain things that your id may want you to do .
3755,"Even though the model is structural and makes reference to an apparatus , the id , ego and super-ego are functions of the mind rather than parts of the brain and do not correspond one-to-one with actual somatic structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience ."
3756,The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud 's thought : the `` structural model '' ( which succeeded his `` economic model '' and `` topographical model '' ) was first discussed in his 1920 essay `` Beyond the Pleasure Principle `` and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his `` The Ego and the Id `` .
3757,Freud 's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term `` unconscious `` and its many conflicting uses .

3766,"AFROTC units at colleges and universities are called `` detachments , '' and are typically headed by an active duty USAF officer in the rank of colonel or lieutenant colonel who functions as both the Detachment Commander for USAF purposes and with the nominal title of Professor of Aerospace Studies ( PAS ) within the institution 's academic community ."
3767,Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies .
3768,"The PAS is assisted by three to four Assistant Professors of Aerospace Studies ( APAS ) , all active duty USAF officers in the ranks of major or captain ."
3769,Three USAF non-commissioned officers and one senior non-commissioned officer will typically provide military administrative support and are often augmented by one to two civilian staff support employees of the academic institution .

3777,Paper products that allow some light to pass through ( e.g . tissue paper ) are considered lightweight .
3778,"In the pulp and paper industry , it is common to set a commercial paper machine to produce paper to a target paper density ."
3779,Paper density can also be used to distinguish paper from paperboard as the latter usually has a grammage greater than 134 g/m2 .
3780,Two ways of expressing paper density are commonly used:
3781,"Expressed in grams per square meter ( g/m2 ) , paper density is also known as grammage ."

3903,Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles ( detritus ) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution .
3904,Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment .
3905,"Before being deposited , sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area , and then transported to the place of deposition by water , wind , ice , mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation ."
3906,"The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth 's crust is extensive , but the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8 % of the total volume of the crust ."

3920,"After becoming a cleric , he returned to northern and western Ireland as an ordained bishop , but little is known about the places where he worked ."
3921,"By the seventh century , he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland ."
3922,"Most available details of his life are from subsequent hagiographies , and these are now not accepted without detailed criticism ."
3923,"The Annals of Ulster state that he arrived in Ireland in 432 , ministered in Ulster around 443 , and died in 457 or 461 ."

3939,"Other names include extreme and mean ratio , medial section , divine proportion , divine section ( Latin : sectio divina ) , golden proportion , golden cut , and golden number ."
3940,"Many 20th century artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle , in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing ( see Applications and observations below ) ."
3941,"Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio , including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle , which can be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio ."
3942,"The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets , in some cases based on dubious fits to data ."

3948,"It involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers ( originally the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but , as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement , Italy did not enter into the war ) ."
3949,"These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers ."
3950,"Ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history ."
3951,"More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility ."
3952,"It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved ."
3953,One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe .
3954,"More immediately , the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia ."

4029,"In cricket , the term innings is both singular and plural and is always spelled and pronounced with the terminal `` s '' ."
4030,"In baseball and softball , the singular form is inning and only the plural takes an `` s '' ."

4050,Poverty is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money .
4051,"Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs , which commonly includes food , water , sanitation , clothing , shelter , health care and education ."
4052,Relative poverty is defined contextually as economic inequality in the location or society in which people live .
4053,"For much of history , poverty was considered largely unavoidable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living ."
4054,"After the industrial revolution , mass production in factories made wealth increasingly more inexpensive and accessible ."
4055,"Of more importance is the modernization of agriculture , such as fertilizers , in order to provide enough yield to feed the population ."
4056,"The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption , tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals ."
4057,"Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare , economic freedoms , and providing financial services ."
4058,Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank .

4066,These symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death .
4067,The toxins present are secondary metabolites produced in specific biochemical pathways in the fungal cells .
4068,Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species .
4069,The most common reason for this misidentification is close resemblance in terms of colour and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species .
4070,"Even very experienced wild mushroom gatherers are upon rare occasion poisoned by eating toxic species , despite being well aware of the risks , through carelessness ."
4071,"To prevent mushroom poisoning , mushroom gatherers need to be very familiar with the mushrooms they intend to collect as well as with any similar-looking toxic species ."

4087,"After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module , they returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 ."
4088,"Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience , Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . ''"
4089,"Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the United States Congress , `` before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . ''"
4090,"Genocide is a term coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin to describe the deliberate and systematic destruction , in whole or in part , of an ethnic , racial , religious , or national group ."

4093,"The preamble to the CPPCG not only states that `` genocide is a crime under international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world '' , but also that `` at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity '' ."
4094,Determining what historical events constitute a genocide and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter .
4095,"In nearly every case where accusations of genocide have circulated , partisans of various sides have fiercely disputed the interpretation and details of the event , often to the point of promoting wildly different versions of the facts ."
4096,An accusation of genocide is certainly not taken lightly and will almost always be controversial .

4107,"Other important influences came from other parts of western Europe , especially Germany , France , and Italy ."
4108,"Original elements also play a strong role , such as the invention of Jeffersonian democracy ."
4109,Thomas Jefferson 's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America 's domestic originality was degenerate .
4110,"Prevalent ideas and ideals that evolved domestically , such as national holidays , uniquely American sports , military tradition , and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole ."

4112,"Despite certain consistent ideological principles ( e.g . individualism , egalitarianism , and faith in freedom and democracy ) , American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity ."
4113,The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a mythic identity ; others see it as American exceptionalism .
4114,"It also includes elements that evolved from Indigenous Americans , and other ethnic cultures—most prominently the culture of African Americans , cultures from Latin America , and Asian American cultures ."
4115,"Many American cultural elements , especially from popular culture , have spread across the globe through modern mass media ."
4116,"The United States has often been thought of as a melting pot , but beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s , it trends towards cultural diversity , pluralism and the image of a salad bowl instead ."

4134,"Eggs are laid by females of many different species , including birds , reptiles , amphibians , and fish , and have been eaten by mankind for thousands of years ."
4135,"Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell , albumen ( egg white ) , and vitellus ( egg yolk ) , contained within various thin membranes ."
4136,"Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken , duck , quail , roe , and caviar , but the egg most often consumed by humans is the chicken egg , by a wide margin ."
4137,"Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline , and are widely used in cookery ."
4138,"Due to their protein content , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) categorizes eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid ."
4139,"Despite the nutritional value of eggs , there are some potential health issues arising from egg quality , storage , and individual allergies ."
4140,"Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are widely kept throughout the world , and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry ."
4141,"In 2009 , an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens ."
4142,"There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation , as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production , with the European Union 's ban on battery farming of chickens ."

4148,The first season took place in 1996 beginning with ten teams .
4149,"Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams , MLS is a single entity where each team is owned and controlled by the league 's investors ."
4150,The league 's closed membership makes it one of the world 's few soccer leagues not using promotion and relegation .
4151,The legality of cannabis varies from country to country .
4152,Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s .
4153,"However , many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis , particularly in North America , South America and Europe ."
4154,"Furthermore , possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law , which governs persons in all states ."
4155,"The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries , including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel ."
4156,"While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis , enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law ; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime , also contrary to federal statute ."
4157,"Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but , apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana , most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe ."
4158,"Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation , use , possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use ."
4159,"A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis , making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment ."
4160,"Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users , with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes ."
4161,There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada .
4162,Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs .
4163,"However , simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries , particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution ."
4164,"In cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction ( EF ) represents the volumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle ( heart ) with each heart beat or cardiac cycle ."
4165,It can be applied to either the right ventricle which ejects via the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary circulation or the left ventricle which ejects via the aortic valve into the systemic circulation .
4166,Imaging of the physiology of the mammalian heart is the art that allows meaningful mathematical expression defining EF .
4167,Noninvasive cardiac imaging has become a worldwide utility enabling study of cardiac performance reproducibly and inexpensively .

4175,"The southern part of the constructed route is a busy commuter freeway serving and connecting the communities of Santa Clarita , Palmdale and Lancaster with the rest of the Greater Los Angeles area ."
4176,"The northern portion , from Vincent ( south of Palmdale ) to Route 395 , is legislatively named the Aerospace Highway , as the highway serves Edwards Air Force Base , once one of the primary landing strips for NASA 's Space Shuttle ."
4177,"This section is rural , following the line between the hot Mojave desert and the forming Sierra Nevada mountain range ."
4178,"Most of Route 14 is loosely paralleled by a main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad , used for the Antelope Valley Line of the Metrolink commuter rail system as well as a connection between Los Angeles and the California Central Valley via Tehachapi Pass ."
4179,"Linked with US 395 , this road connects Los Angeles with such places as Mammoth Mountain , Mono Lake , Yosemite National Park and Reno , Nevada ."
4180,"Route 14 was part of U.S. Route 6 prior to truncation in 1964 , when U.S. 6 was a coast-to-coast route from Long Beach to Provincetown , Massachusetts ."

4184,Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors .
4185,Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness .
4186,"Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP , an abbreviation for `` no light perception . ''"
4187,Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with vision .
4188,Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source .
4189,"To determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities , various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as legal blindness ."
4190,"In North America and most of Europe , legal blindness is defined as visual acuity ( vision ) of 20/200 ( 6/60 ) or less in the better eye with best correction possible ."
4191,This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand from an object to see it—with corrective lenses —with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from .
4192,"In many areas , people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees ( the norm being 180 degrees ) are also classified as being legally blind ."
4193,"Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind , by any measure , have no vision ."
4194,"The rest have some vision , from light perception alone to relatively good acuity ."
4195,Low vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200 .
4196,"By the 10th Revision of the WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases , Injuries and Causes of Death , low vision is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/60 ( 6/18 ) , but equal to or better than 20/200 ( 6/60 ) , or corresponding visual field loss to less than 20 degrees , in the better eye with best possible correction ."
4197,"Blindness is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/400 ( 6/120 ) , or corresponding visual field loss to less than 10 degrees , in the better eye with best possible correction ."
4198,Blind people with undamaged eyes may still register light non-visually for the purpose of circadian entrainment to the 24-hour light/dark cycle .
4199,Light signals for this purpose travel through the retinohypothalamic tract and are not affected by optic nerve damage beyond where the retinohypothalamic tract exits .

4209,"Bugs Bunny is a funny animal cartoon character , best remembered for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of theatrical short films produced by Warner Bros. during the Golden age of American animation ."
4210,His popularity during this era led to his becoming a corporate mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment .
4211,"Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray hare or rabbit who is famous for his flippant , personality , a pronounced New York accent , his portrayal as a trickster , and his catch phrase `` Eh ..."
4212,"What 's up , doc ? ''"
4213,( usually said while chewing a carrot ) .
4214,Bugs has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character and is the ninth most portrayed film personality in the world .
4215,"According to his 1990 `` biography '' Bugs Bunny : 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare , Bugs was born on July 27 , 1940 in Brooklyn , New York in a warren under Ebbets Field , home of the Brooklyn Dodgers ."
4216,"In reality , he was brought to life by the animators and staff of Leon Schlesinger Productions ( later Warner Bros. Cartoons ) : including Tex Avery , who directed Bugs ' early definitive short A Wild Hare ( 1940 ) ; Robert McKimson , who created Bugs ' definitive character design ; and Mel Blanc , who originated the voice of Bugs ."
4217,"The mucous membranes ( or mucosae or mucosas ; singular mucosa ) are linings of mostly endodermal origin , covered in epithelium , which are involved in absorption and secretion ."
4218,They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs .
4219,"They are at several places contiguous with skin : at the nostrils , the lips of the mouth , the eyelids , the ears , the genital area , and the anus ."
4220,"The sticky , thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus ."
4221,The term mucous membrane refers to where they are found in the body and not every mucous membrane secretes mucus .
4222,"The glans clitoridis , glans penis ( head of the penis ) , along with the inside of the foreskin and the clitoral hood , are mucous membranes ."
4223,The urethra is also a mucous membrane .

4228,"In its oldest forms , cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes , and normally had a disk shape ."
4229,"Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread , cake , or pastry can be difficult ."
4230,"Modern cake , especially layer cakes , normally contain a combination of flour , sugar , eggs , and butter or oil , with some varieties also requiring liquid ( typically milk or water ) and leavening agents ( such as yeast or baking powder ) ."
4231,"Flavorful ingredients like fruit purées , nuts , dried or candied fruit , or extracts are often added , and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients are possible ."
4232,"Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces ( like pastry cream ) , iced with buttercream or other icings , and decorated with marzipan , piped borders or candied fruit ."
4233,"Cake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions , particularly weddings , anniversaries , and birthdays ."
4234,"There are countless cake recipes ; some are bread-like , some rich and elaborate , and many are centuries old ."
4235,"Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure ; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making ( particularly the whisking of egg foams ) , baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake ."

4243,Public policy is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs .
4244,"In general , the foundation is the pertinent national and substantial constitutional law and implementing legislation such as the US Federal code ."
4245,Further substrates include both judicial interpretations and regulations which are generally authorized by legislation .
4246,"Other scholars define it as a system of `` courses of action , regulatory measures , laws , and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives . ''"
4247,"Public policy is commonly embodied `` in constitutions , legislative acts , and judicial decisions . ''"
4248,"In the United States , this concept refers not only to the result of policies , but more broadly to the decision-making and analysis of governmental decisions ."

4251,"Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream , for instance ."
4252,Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones .
4253,"When food enters the mouth , digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva ."
4254,"Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ."
4255,"After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus ."
4256,It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis .
4257,Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion .
4258,Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin .
4259,"As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals ."
4260,"At the same time protein digestion is occurring , mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall ."
4261,This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes .
4262,"After some time ( typically an hour or two in humans , 4–6 hours in dogs , somewhat shorter duration in house cats ) , the resulting thick liquid is called chyme ."
4263,"When the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas , and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues ."
4264,"When the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood ."
4265,95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine .
4266,Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon ( large intestine ) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9 .
4267,"Some vitamins , such as biotin and vitamin K ( K2MK7 ) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon ."
4268,Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation .
4269,Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was king of England from 21 April 1509 until his death .
4270,"He was lord , and later king , of Ireland , as well as continuing the nominal claim by the English monarchs to the Kingdom of France ."
4271,"Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII ."
4272,"Besides his six marriages , Henry VIII is known for his role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church ."
4273,"Henry 's struggles with Rome led to the separation of the Church of England from papal authority , the Dissolution of the Monasteries , and his own establishment as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ."
4274,"Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings , even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church ."
4275,Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 .
4276,"In 1513 , the new king allied with the Holy Roman Emperor , Maximillian I , and invaded France in 1513 with a large , well-equipped army , but achieved little at a considerable financial cost ."
4277,"Maximillian , for his part , used the English invasion to his own ends , and this prejudiced England 's ability to defeat the French ."
4278,"This foray would prove the start of an obsession for Henry , who invaded again in 1544 ."
4279,"This time , Henry 's forces captured the important city of Boulogne , but again the Holy Roman Emperor , Charles V , supported Henry only as long as he needed to and England , strained by the enormous cost of the war , ransomed the city back for peace ."
4280,"His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' ."
4281,"Besides ruling with absolute power , he also engaged himself as an author and composer ."
4282,His desire to provide England with a male heir – which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the Tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses – led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and the English Reformation .
4283,"Henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 ."
4284,"He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king ."
4285,Bongos ( Spanish : bongó ) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument .
4286,The drums are of different size : the larger drum is called in Spanish the hembra ( female ) and the smaller the macho ( male ) .
4287,"They are membranophones , or instruments that create sound by a vibration of a stretched membrane ."
4288,"Different religious groups include different books in their Biblical canons , in varying orders , and sometimes divide or combine books , or incorporate additional material into canonical books ."
4289,Christian Bibles range from the sixty-six books of the Protestant canon to the eighty-one books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon .
4290,"The Hebrew Bible , or Tanakh , contains twenty-four books divided into three parts ; the five books of the Torah ( `` teaching '' or `` law '' ) , the Nevi'im ( `` prophets '' ) , and the Ketuvim ( `` writings '' ) ."
4291,"The first part of Christian Bibles is the Old Testament , which contains , at minimum , the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible divided into thirty-nine books and ordered differently from the Hebrew Bible ."
4292,The Catholic Church and Eastern Christian churches also hold certain deuterocanonical books and passages to be part of the Old Testament canon .
4293,"The second part is the New Testament , containing twenty-seven books ; the four Canonical gospels , Acts of the Apostles , twenty-one Epistles or letters and the Book of Revelation ."
4294,"The Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books ."
4295,The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive : if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here .
4296,"Dred Scott v. Sandford , , also known as the Dred Scott Decision , was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court ."
4297,It made two main rulings .
4298,"The first ruling was that African-Americans were not citizens , and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court ."
4299,The second ruling was that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the creation of the United States .
4300,"Given the first ruling , most scholars and many contemporary political figures ( including the leadership of the then-new Republican Party ) considered that the second ruling was not binding precedent , but mere dictum ."
4301,The rationale of the Supreme Court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of African descent ( both slave and free ) were not protected by the Constitution and were not U.S. citizens .
4302,"Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent ."
4303,"Nonetheless , the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court ."
4304,"The opinion of the court , written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney , stirred debate ."
4305,"The decision was 7–2 , and every Justice besides Taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissent ."
4306,"For the first time since Marbury v. Madison , the Court held an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional ."
4307,"Dred Scott , an African-American slave , had asked a United States Circuit Court to award him his freedom because he and his master had resided in a state ( Illinois ) and a territory ( Wisconsin Territory ) where slavery had been banned ."
4308,"Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the court , held that Scott , as a person of African ancestry , was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal court ."
4309,"This holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time , particularly Free states , where free blacks did in fact enjoy the rights of citizens , such as the right to vote and hold public office ."
4310,"In what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum , the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because slaves are personal property and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law ."
4311,"In reaching this decision , Taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the United States , but it had the opposite effect ."
4312,"The decision was fiercely debated across the country , as perhaps best exemplified by the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858 ."
4313,"Abraham Lincoln , the second-ever Republican nominee for President , was able to win the presidential election in 1860 ; the stopping of the further expansion of slavery was a key Republican party plank ."
4314,"The decision played an important role in the timing of state secession and the Civil War , although it is extreme to say the decision `` caused '' the war ."
4315,The decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape : it is credited with launching Abraham Lincoln’s national political career and ultimately allowing for his election .
4316,"Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case , the Court stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , which begins by stating , `` All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . ''"
4317,To which the Court noted:
4318,"The first observation we have to make on this clause is , that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion ."
4319,"It declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State , and it overturns the Dred Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States ."
4320,"There are dozens of neighborhoods in Columbus , Ohio ."

4346,"The USA won its first seven games at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan before losing against Greece in the semi-finals , ending the competition with the bronze medal ."
4347,"The USA won gold two years later , though , at the 2008 Summer Olympics with a dominant performance ."
4348,"This success was followed up at the 2010 FIBA World Championship , where despite fielding a roster featuring no players from the 2008 Olympic team , the USA did not lose a single game en route to defeating host Turkey for the gold medal ."
4349,The USA continued this streak of dominance by going undefeated and capturing gold once more at the 2012 Summer Olympics .

4357,"A stalagmite ( or ; from the Greek σταλαγμίτης - stalagmitês , from σταλαγμίας - stalagmias , `` dropping , trickling '' ) is a type of speleothem that rises from the floor of a limestone cave due to the dripping of mineralized solutions and the deposition of calcium carbonate ."
4358,This stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the underground cavern .
4359,The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite .
4360,"If these formations grow together , the result is known as a column ."
4361,The Hall of Giants in the Carlsbad Caverns
4362,"Stalagmites should normally not be touched , since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the old surface ; skin oils can alter the surface where the mineral water will cling , thus affecting the growth of the formation ."
4363,Oils and dirt from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently .
4364,"Similar structures can also form in lava tubes , associated with some types of lavacicles , although the mechanism of formation is very different ."
4365,"Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors , although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment ."
4366,"The largest stalagmite in the world is high and is located in the cave of Cueva Martin Infierno , Cuba ."
4367,"In the Zagros Mountains of south Iran , approximately from the ancient city of Bishapur , in the Shapur cave on the fourth of five terraces stands the 3rd century CE statue of Shapur I , second ruler of the Sassanid Empire ."

4468,Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen ( the `` glass '' ) or through a document feeder .
4469,"The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF , allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes ."
4470,"Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines , some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner , faxing multi-page documents to themselves ."
4471,"Document feeders are described by speed , in pages per minute or ppm , and capacity , usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200 ."
4472,"There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided ( duplex ) scanning : a reversing automatic document feeder or RADF scans one side of a page , then flips it and scans the other side ."
4473,A duplexing automatic document feeder or DADF scans both sides in one pass .
4474,The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals .

4491,San Jose experienced increased demand for housing from soldiers and veterans returning from World War II .
4492,San Jose then continued its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area .
4493,"The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center , to an urbanized metropolitan area ."
4494,"By the 1990s , San Jose 's location within the booming local technology industry earned the city its nickname , Capital of Silicon Valley ."
4495,"San Jose now maintains global city status and is the largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area in terms of population , land area , and industrial development ."
4496,"The U.S. Census Bureau reported the population of the city to be 945,942 as of the 2010 Census ."
4497,"As of April 2013 , the estimated population of San Jose was 984,000 ."
4498,"San Jose , along with the Santa Clara Valley , experienced about half a century of spectacular suburban sprawl , with characteristics of intense urbanization similar to the Los Angeles area of Southern California ."
4499,The city has taken definite steps to avoid becoming `` L.A. North '' .
4500,"However , the sprawl in San Jose is worse than in Los Angeles by measures such as population density and public transit safety , investment , and ridership ."

4552,Artist 's conception of a protoplanetary disk
4553,The formation and of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud .
4554,"Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre , forming the Sun , while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets , moons , asteroids , and other small Solar System bodies formed ."
4555,"This widely accepted model , known as the nebular hypothesis , was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg , Immanuel Kant , and Pierre-Simon Laplace ."
4556,"Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy , physics , geology , and planetary science ."
4557,"Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s , the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations ."
4558,The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation .
4559,"Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets , while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets ."
4560,"Still others , as the Earth 's Moon , may be the result of giant collisions ."
4561,Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System .

4610,"As a medical diagnosis , pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in persons 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive sexual interest toward prepubescent children ( generally age 11 years or younger , though specific diagnosis criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13 ) ."
4611,An adolescent who is 16 years of age or older must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child before the attraction can be diagnosed as pedophilia .
4612,"The term has a range of definitions , as found in psychiatry , psychology , the vernacular , and law enforcement ."
4613,The International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) defines pedophilia as a `` disorder of adult personality and behaviour '' in which there is a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age .
4614,"According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , it is a paraphilia in which adults or adolescents 16 years of age or older have intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that they have either acted on or which cause them distress or interpersonal difficulty ."
4615,"In popular usage , pedophilia means any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse , often termed `` pedophilic behavior '' ."
4616,"For example , The American Heritage Stedman 's Medical Dictionary states , `` Pedophilia is the act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children . ''"
4617,This common use application also extends to the sexual interest in and sexual contact with pubescent or post-pubescent minors .
4618,"Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse commonly exhibit the disorder , some offenders do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards for pedophilia and these standards pertain to prepubescents ."
4619,"Additionally , not all pedophiles actually commit such abuse ."
4620,Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century .
4621,A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s .
4622,"Although mostly documented in men , there are also women who exhibit the disorder , and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles ."
4623,"No cure for pedophilia has been developed , but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse ."
4624,"In the United States , following Kansas v. Hendricks , sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders , particularly pedophilia , can be subject to indefinite civil commitment , under various state laws ( generically called SVP laws ) and the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 ."
4625,"At present , the exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established ."
4626,"Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities , and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies ."

4814,"A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy , authority , or control on the Internet ."
4815,Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) .
4816,"Technically , any name registered in the DNS is a domain name ."
4817,Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes .
4818,"In general , a domain name represents an Internet Protocol ( IP ) resource , such as a personal computer used to access the Internet , a server computer hosting a web site , or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet ."
4819,"Domain names are organized in subordinate levels ( subdomains ) of the DNS root domain , which is nameless ."
4820,"The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains ( TLDs ) , including the generic top-level domains ( gTLDs ) , such as the prominent domains com , info , net and org , and the country code top-level domains ( ccTLDs ) ."
4821,"Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet , create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites ."
4822,The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public .
4823,"A fully qualified domain name ( FQDN ) is a domain name that is completely specified in the hierarchy of the DNS , having no omitted parts ."
4824,"Domain names are usually written in lowercase , although labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive ."

4832,"The Mpemba effect , named after Tanzanian student Erasto Mpemba , is the assertion that warmer water can freeze faster than colder water ."
4833,"Although there is anecdotal support for the effect , there is no agreement on exactly what the effect is and under what circumstances it occurs ."
4834,"There have been reports of similar phenomena since ancient times , although with insufficient detail for the claims to be replicated ."
4835,"The phenomenon seems contrary to thermodynamics , but a number of possible explanations for the effect have been proposed ."
4836,Further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of `` freezing '' and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect .

4841,"In economics , the money supply or money stock , is the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time ."
4842,"There are several ways to define `` money , '' but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits ( depositors ' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions ) ."
4843,"Money supply data are recorded and published , usually by the government or the central bank of the country ."
4844,"Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in money supply because of its effects on the price level , inflation , the exchange rate and the business cycle ."
4845,That relation between money and prices is historically associated with the quantity theory of money .
4846,"There is strong empirical evidence of a direct relation between money-supply growth and long-term price inflation , at least for rapid increases in the amount of money in the economy ."
4847,"That is , a country such as Zimbabwe which saw rapid increases in its money supply also saw rapid increases in prices ( hyperinflation ) ."
4848,This is one reason for the reliance on monetary policy as a means of controlling inflation .
4849,The nature of this causal chain is the subject of contention .
4850,"Some heterodox economists argue that the money supply is endogenous ( determined by the workings of the economy , not by the central bank ) and that the sources of inflation must be found in the distributional structure of the economy ."
4851,"In addition , those economists seeing the central bank 's control over the money supply as feeble say that there are two weak links between the growth of the money supply and the inflation rate ."
4852,"First , in the aftermath of a recession , when many resources are underutilized , an increase in the money supply can cause a sustained increase in real production instead of inflation ."
4853,"Second , if the velocity of money , i.e. , the ratio between nominal GDP and money supply , changes , an increase in the money supply could have either no effect , an exaggerated effect , or an unpredictable effect on the growth of nominal GDP ."

4870,"It is caused by having something cold touch the roof of the mouth ( palate ) , and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels or a `` referring `` of pain from the roof of the mouth to the head ."
4871,The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor .
4872,There are people who can not experience `` brain freeze '' or similar symptoms .
4873,"The term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least 31 January 1937 , contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book We did n't ask Utopia : a Quaker family in Soviet Russia ."

4875,`` Auld Lang Syne '' ( : note `` s '' rather than `` z '' ) is a Scots poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song ( Roud # 6294 ) .
4876,"It is well known in many countries , especially in the English-speaking world ; its traditional use being to celebrate the start of the New Year at the stroke of midnight ."
4877,"By extension , it is also sung at funerals , graduations and as a farewell or ending to other occasions ."
4878,"The international Boy Scout youth movement , in many countries , uses it as a close to jamborees and other functions ."
4879,"The song 's Scots title may be translated into English literally as `` old long since '' , or more idiomatically , `` long long ago '' , `` days gone by '' or `` old times '' ."
4880,"Consequently `` For auld lang syne '' , as it appears in the first line of the chorus , might be loosely translated as `` for ( the sake of ) old times '' ."
4881,"The phrase `` Auld Lang Syne '' is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton ( 1570–1638 ) , Allan Ramsay ( 1686–1757 ) , and James Watson ( 1711 ) as well as older folk songs predating Burns ."
4882,Matthew Fitt uses the phrase `` In the days of auld lang syne '' as the equivalent of `` Once upon a time ...

4900,He resigned his position and pleaded not guilty .
4901,"The trial began on June 10 , 2010 ."
4902,"Michael Rains , Mehserle 's criminal defense attorney , argued that Mehserle mistakenly shot Grant with his pistol , intending to use his Taser when he saw Grant reaching for his waistband ."

4992,"Pressure ulcers , also known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores , are localized injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence , as a result of pressure , or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction ."
4993,"Most commonly this will be the sacrum , coccyx , heels or the hips , but other sites such as the elbows , knees , ankles or the back of the cranium can be affected ."
4994,The cause of pressure ulcers is pressure applied to soft tissue so that blood flow to the soft tissue is completely or partially obstructed .
4995,Shear is also a cause ; shear pulls on blood vessels that feed the skin .
4996,Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in persons who are not moving about or are confined to wheelchairs .
4997,It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development .
4998,"These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition , microclimate ( skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence ) , diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin , such as arteriosclerosis or diseases that reduce the feeling in the skin , such as paralysis or neuropathy ."
4999,"The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person , medical conditions ( such as arteriosclerosis , diabetes or infection ) , smoking or medications such as antiinflammatory drugs ."
5000,"Although often prevented and treatable if found early , pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill patients , frail elders , wheelchair users ( especially where spinal injury is involved ) and terminally ill patients ."
5001,Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by turning the patient regularly .
5002,The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century .
5003,"In addition to turning and re-positioning the patient in bed or wheelchair , eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is very important ."
5004,"The prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high , but improvements are being made ."
5005,"According to the 2010 IPUP ( International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey ) conducted in Canada , there was a significant decrease in the overall facility-acquired prevalence of pressure ulcers from 2009-2010 ."
5006,"Ulcers were most commonly identified at the sacral/coccyx ulcer location ; however , heel ulcers were the most common facility-acquired location in the survey ."

5537,The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body 's homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure .
5538,"It provides a negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes heart rate to decrease therefore causing blood pressure to decrease ; likewise , decreased blood pressure activates the baroreflex , causing heart rate to increase thus causing an increase in blood pressure ."
5539,"The system relies on specialized neurons , known as baroreceptors , in the aortic arch , carotid sinuses , and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the brainstem ."
5540,Subsequent changes in blood pressure are mediated by the autonomic nervous system .

5547,Pawn in the standard Staunton pattern
5548,"The pawn ( ♙♟ ) is the most numerous and in most circumstances the weakest piece in the game of chess , historically representing infantry or , more particularly , armed peasants or pikemen ."
5549,"In chess , each player begins the game with eight pawns , one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces ."
5550,"( In algebraic notation , the white pawns start on a2 , b2 , c2 , ... , h2 , while black pawns start on a7 , b7 , c7 , ... , h7 . )"
5551,Individual pawns are referred to by the file on which they stand .
5552,"For example , one speaks of `` White 's f-pawn '' or `` Black 's b-pawn '' , or less commonly ( using descriptive notation ) , `` White 's king 's bishop pawn '' or `` Black 's queen 's knight pawn '' ."

5557,Hydrogen production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen .
5558,Currently the dominant technology for direct production is steam reforming from hydrocarbons .
5559,Many other methods are known including electrolysis and thermolysis .
5560,"In 2006 , the United States was estimated to have a production capacity of 11 million tonnes of hydrogen ."
5561,"5 million tonnes of hydrogen were consumed on-site in oil refining , and in the production of ammonia ( Haber process ) and methanol ( reduction of carbon monoxide ) ."
5562,0.4 million tonnes were an incidental by-product of the chlor-alkali process .
5563,Hydrogen production is an estimated $ 100 billion industry .
5564,"A basis point ( often denoted as bp , colloquially referred to in the plural as `` bips '' , also known as a `` beep '' ) is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point , or one part per ten thousand , 1/10000 ."
5565,"The same unit is also ( rarely ) called a permyriad , literally meaning 'for ( every ) myriad ( ten thousand ) ' , and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign ( % ) with two extra zeroes at the end ( like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator , although it originates as a natural extension of the percent ( % ) and permille ( ‰ ) signs ) ."
5566,A basis point is defined as:
5567,1 basis point = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent
5568,1 bp = 1 = 0.01 % = 0.1‰ = 10−4 = = 0.0001
5569,1 % = 100 bp = 100
5570,Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1 % are discussed .
5571,"The most common example is interest rates , where differences in interest rates of less than 1 % per year are usually meaningful to talk about ."
5572,"For example , a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points ( e.g . a 4.67 % rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77 % ) ."
5573,"Like percentage points , basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate ."
5574,"For example , if a report says there has been a `` 1 % increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , this could refer to an increase either from 10 % to 10.1 % ( relative , 1 % of 10 % ) , or from 10 % to 11 % ( absolute , 1 % plus 10 % ) ."
5575,"If , however , the report says there has been a `` 10 basis point increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , then we know that the interest rate of 10 % has increased by 0.10 % ( the absolute change ) to a 10.1 % rate ."
5576,"It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument , or the difference ( spread ) between two interest rates , including the yields of fixed-income securities ."
5577,"Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security , they will often be quoted as a spread over ( or under ) the index ."
5578,"For example , a loan that bears interest of 0.50 % per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR , which is commonly expressed as `` L+50bps '' or simply `` L+50 '' ."
5579,The term `` basis point '' has its origins in trading the `` basis '' or the spread between two interest rates .
5580,"Since the basis is usually small , these are quoted multiplied up by 10000 , and hence a `` full point '' movement in the `` basis '' is a basis point ."
5581,Contrast with pips in FX forward markets .
5582,"The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows : 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points , and 0.01 percentage points = 1 basis point ."
5583,"So , a bond whose yield increases from 5 % to 5.5 % is said to increase by 50 basis points ; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points ."
5584,The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom .
5585,"The term is also commonly applied to the same group of people who are the relations of the monarch in her or his role as sovereign of any of the other Commonwealth realms , thus sometimes at variance with official national terms for the family ."
5586,"Members of the Royal Family belong to , either by birth or marriage , the House of Windsor , since 1917 , when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ."
5587,This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family 's strong German ancestry ; it was felt that its public image could be improved by choosing a more British house name .
5588,"The new name chosen , Windsor , had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence ."
5589,"Although in the United Kingdom there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family , and different lists will include different people , those carrying the style Her or His Majesty ( HM ) , or Her or His Royal Highness ( HRH ) are always considered members , which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch , the consort of the monarch , the widowed consorts of previous monarchs , the children of the monarch and previous monarchs , the male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs , and the spouses and the widows of a monarch 's and previous monarch 's sons and male-line grandsons ."
5590,"On 30 November 1917 , King George V issued Letters Patent defining who are members of the Royal Family ; the text of the notice from the London Gazette is as follows:"
5591,"In 1996 , Her Majesty The Queen modified these Letters Patent , as was evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette:"
5592,"In 2013 Letters Patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the Royal Family to additional persons to be born , evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette:"
5593,"Members and relatives of the British Royal Family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the British Empire , sometimes for extended periods as viceroys , or for specific ceremonies or events ."
5594,"Today , they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom ."
5595,"Aside from the monarch , their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve , if eligible and when appointed by letters patent , as a Counsellor of State , two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown ( within stipulated limits ) in the indisposal or absence from the British realm of the monarch ."
5596,In the other realms of the Commonwealth royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State .
5597,"However in each such realm the monarch 's family members may act on behalf of , are funded by , and represent the sovereign of that particular state , and not the United Kingdom ."
5598,"The Queen , her consort , her children and grandchildren , as well as all former sovereigns ' children and grandchildren hold places in the first sections of the official orders of precedence in England and Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland ."
5599,"Wives of the said enjoy their husbands ' precedence , and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well ."
5600,"However , the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the Royal Family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra , who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall , who is otherwise the realm 's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself ."
5601,"She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses , such as the daughters of her younger sons ."

5631,"A Motorola Advisor alphanumeric pager used in Brazil in the 1990s , operated by Teletrim"
5632,"A pager is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays numeric or text messages , or receives and announces voice messages ."
5633,"One-way pagers can only receive messages , while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge , reply to , and originate messages using an internal transmitter ."
5634,"Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters ( or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers , one or more base stations ) , as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users ."
5635,"These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter , to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations ."
5636,One of the first practical paging services was launched in 1950 for physicians in the New York City area .
5637,Physicians paid US $ 12 per month for the service and carried a ( 6 oz ) pager that would receive phone messages within ( 25 mi ) of a single transmitter tower .
5638,The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company and operated by Telanswerphone .
5639,"In 1960 , John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola 's Walkie Talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the first transistorized pager , and from this point , paging technology continued to advance , and pager adoption continued to expand , until the early 1990s ."
5640,"However , by the mid-1990s , as cellular technologies became cheaper and more widely available , advanced services began to displace paging as a commercial product ."

5668,"Thus , the festival is now 17 days when the first Sunday is October 2 and 18 days when it is October 1 ."
5669,"In 2010 , the festival lasted until the first Monday in October , to mark the anniversary of the event ."
5670,"The festival is held in an area named the Theresienwiese ( field , or meadow , of Therese ) , often called Wiesn for short , located near Munich 's center ."

5675,Cheese is a generic term for a diverse group of milk-based food products .
5676,"Cheese is produced in wide-ranging flavors , textures , and forms ."
5677,"Cheese consists of proteins and fat from milk , usually the milk of cows , buffalo , goats , or sheep ."
5678,It is produced by coagulation of the milk protein casein .
5679,"Typically , the milk is acidified and addition of the enzyme rennet causes coagulation ."
5680,The solids are separated and pressed into final form .
5681,Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout .
5682,Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature .
5683,Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced .
5684,"Their styles , textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk ( including the animal 's diet ) , whether they have been pasteurized , the butterfat content , the bacteria and mold , the processing , and aging ."
5685,"Herbs , spices , or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents ."
5686,"The yellow to red color of many cheeses , such as Red Leicester , is normally formed from adding annatto ."
5687,"For a few cheeses , the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice ."
5688,"Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria , which turn milk sugars into lactic acid , then the addition of rennet completes the curdling ."
5689,"Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available ; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei , but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family ."
5690,"Cheese is valued for its portability , long life , and high content of fat , protein , calcium , and phosphorus ."
5691,"Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk , although how long a cheese will keep may depend on the type of cheese ; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening ."
5692,"Generally speaking , hard cheeses last longer than soft cheeses , such as Brie or goat 's milk cheese ."
5693,"Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher , lower-priced milk , and lower shipping costs ."
5694,"The long storage life of some cheese , especially if it is encased in a protective rind , allows selling when markets are favorable ."
5695,"Additional ingredients may be added to some cheeses , such as black peppers , garlic , chives or cranberries ."
5696,A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger .
5697,"To become an expert in this field , like wine or cooking , requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience ."
5698,"This position is typically responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory ; selecting the cheese menu , purchasing , receiving , storage , and ripening ."
5699,Legal citation signals are a set of brief abbreviated phrases or words used to clarify the authority or significance of a legal citation as it relates to a proposition .
5700,Signals help a reader quickly discern meaning or usefulness of a particular reference when the reference itself does not provide adequate information .
5701,Most citation signals are placed in front of the citation to which they apply .
5702,"For example , in the paragraph When writing a legal argument , it is important to refer to primary sources ."
5703,"To assist readers in locating these sources , it is desirable to use a standardized citation format ."
5704,"See generally Harvard Law Review Association , The Bluebook : A Uniform System of Citation ( 18th ed . 2005 ) ."
5705,"Note , however , that some courts may require any legal papers that are submitted to them to conform to a different citation format ."
5706,"the signal is the phrase `` see generally , '' which indicates that the citation `` The Bluebook : A Uniform System of Citation ( 18th ed . 2005 ) '' provides general background information on the topic ."

5751,Near Rome .
5752,The Appian Way ( Latin and Italian : Via Appia ) was one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic .
5753,"It connected Rome to Brindisi , Apulia , in southeast Italy ."
5754,"Its importance is indicated by its common name , recorded by Statius :"
5755,Appia teritur regina longarum viarum
5756,`` the Appian way is the queen of the long roads ''
5757,"The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus , the Roman censor who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC during the Samnite Wars ."
5758,"The Draupner wave , a single giant wave measured on New Year 's Day 1995 , finally confirmed the existence of freak waves , which had previously been considered near-mythical"
5759,"Rogue waves ( also known as freak waves , monster waves , killer waves , extreme waves , and abnormal waves ) are relatively large and spontaneous ocean surface waves that occur far out at sea , and are a threat even to large ships and ocean liners ."
5760,"In oceanography , they are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height ( SWH ) , which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record ."
5761,"Therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea ; they are , rather , surprisingly large waves for a given sea state ."
5762,"Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause , but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave ."
5763,Electress Sophia of Hanover ( 1630–1714 )
5764,The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms .
5765,The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics .
5766,"The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed , but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line ."
5767,"At a summit in Perth , Western Australia in 2011 , the heads of government of all 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to adopt absolute primogeniture , end the exclusion of people married to Roman Catholics , and make other changes in the succession rules ."
5768,The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State ( and a regent if the need arises ) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937 .

5774,"Clift received four Academy Award nominations during his career , three for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting Actor ."
5775,The War on Terror ( also known as the Global War on Terrorism ) is a term commonly applied to an international military campaign which started as a result of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States .
5776,This resulted in an international military campaign to eliminate al-Qaeda and other militant organizations .
5777,The United Kingdom and many other NATO and non-NATO nations participate in the conflict .
5778,The phrase 'War on Terror ' was first used by US President George W. Bush on 20 September 2001 .
5779,"The Bush administration and the Western media have since used the term to signify a global military , political , lawful , and conceptual struggle—targeting both organizations designated as terrorist and regimes accused of supporting them ."
5780,"It was typically used with a particular focus on militant Islamists , al-Qaeda , and other jihadi groups ."
5781,"Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President Barack Obama ( which instead uses the term Overseas Contingency Operation ) , it is still commonly used by politicians , in the media and by some aspects of government officially , such as the United States ' Global War on Terrorism Service Medal ."

5784,"The main causes of World War II were nationalistic issues , unresolved issues , and resentments resulting from World War I and the interwar period in Europe , in addition to the effects of the Great Depression in the 1930s ."
5785,The culmination of events that led to the outbreak of war are generally understood to be the 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany and Soviet Russia and the 1937 invasion of the Republic of China by the Empire of Japan .
5786,These military aggressions were the result of decisions made by the authoritarian ruling Nazi elite in Germany and by the leadership of the Kwantung Army in Japan .
5787,World War II started after these aggressive actions were met with an official declaration of war and/or armed resistance .

5790,The Mitsubishi Galant is an automobile manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors between 1969 and 2012 .
5791,"The name was derived from the French word galant , meaning `` chivalrous '' ."
5792,"There have been nine distinct generations , and cumulative sales now exceed five million ."
5793,"It began as a compact sedan , but over the course of its life has evolved into a larger mid-size car ."
5794,"Initial production was only based in Japan , but since 1994 the American market has been served by vehicles assembled at the former Diamond-Star Motors ( DSM ) facility in Normal , Illinois ."
5795,"Blood pressure ( BP ) , sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure , is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels , and is one of the principal vital signs ."
5796,"When used without further specification , `` blood pressure '' usually refers to the arterial pressure of the systemic circulation ."
5797,"During each heartbeat , blood pressure varies between a maximum ( systolic ) and a minimum ( diastolic ) pressure ."
5798,The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart .
5799,Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation .
5800,The rate of mean blood flow depends on the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels .
5801,Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy .
5802,"Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation , although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles ."
5803,"Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces ( e.g. , during standing ) and valves in veins , breathing , and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins ."
5804,"Blood pressure without further specification usually refers to the systemic arterial pressure measured at a person 's upper arm and is a measure of the pressure in the brachial artery , the major artery in the upper arm ."
5805,"A person’s blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimetres of mercury ( mmHg ) , for example 120/80 ."
5806,"A veto – Latin for `` I forbid '' – is the power ( used by an officer of the state , for example ) to unilaterally stop an official action , especially the enactment of legislation ."
5807,"A veto can be absolute , as for instance in the United Nations Security Council , whose permanent members ( China , France , Russia , United Kingdom , United States of America ) can block any resolution ."
5808,"Or it can be limited , as in the legislative process of the United States , where a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate may override a Presidential veto of legislation ."
5809,"A veto only gives power to stop changes , not to adopt them ( except for the rare `` amendatory veto '' ) ."
5810,Thus a veto allows its holder to protect the status quo .
5811,The concept of a veto body originated with the Roman consuls and tribunes .
5812,Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other ; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate .
5813,Sulfur dioxide ( also sulphur dioxide ) is the chemical compound with the formula .
5814,"It is a toxic gas with a pungent , irritating smell , that is released by volcanoes and in various industrial processes ."
5815,"Since coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds , their combustion generates sulfur dioxide unless the sulfur compounds are removed before burning the fuel ."
5816,"Further oxidation of SO2 , usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2 , forms H2SO4 , and thus acid rain ."
5817,Sulfur dioxide emissions are also a precursor to particulates in the atmosphere .
5818,Both of these impacts are cause for concern over the environmental impact of these fuels .
5819,"Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek μύς `` muscle '' , `` weakness '' , and `` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability ."
5820,"It is an autoimmune disorder , in which weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors throughout neuromuscular junctions ."
5821,"Myasthenia is treated medically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ."
5822,The disease incidence is 3–30 cases per million per year and rising as a result of increased awareness .
5823,MG must be distinguished from congenital myasthenic syndromes that can present similar symptoms but offer no response to immunosuppressive treatments .

5833,"( In a backlit LCD , this layer is replaced with a light source . )"
5834,"A liquid-crystal display ( LCD ) is a flat panel display , electronic visual display , or video display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals ."
5835,Liquid crystals do not emit light directly .
5836,"LCDs are available to display arbitrary images ( as in a general-purpose computer display ) or fixed images which can be displayed or hidden , such as preset words , digits , and 7-segment displays as in a digital clock ."
5837,"They use the same basic technology , except that arbitrary images are made up of a large number of small pixels , while other displays have larger elements ."
5838,"LCDs are used in a wide range of applications including computer monitors , televisions , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and signage ."
5839,"They are common in consumer devices such as video players , gaming devices , clocks , watches , calculators , and telephones , and have replaced cathode ray tube ( CRT ) displays in most applications ."
5840,"They are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays , and since they do not use phosphors , they do not suffer image burn-in ."
5841,"LCDs are , however , susceptible to image persistence ."
5842,The LCD screen is more energy efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT .
5843,Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery -powered electronic equipment .
5844,It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of segments filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source ( backlight ) or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome .
5845,Liquid crystals were first discovered in 1888 .
5846,"By 2008 , worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded annual sales of CRT units ; the CRT became obsolete for most purposes ."
5847,"The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa is a luxury hotel , casino , and spa in Atlantic City , New Jersey , United States ."

5851,A bottle of high potency B-complex vitamin supplement pills .
5852,A vitamin ( or ) is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts .
5853,"An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from the diet ."
5854,"Thus , the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism ."
5855,"For example , ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans , but not for most other animals , and biotin and vitamin D are required in the human diet only in certain circumstances ."
5856,"By convention , the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients , such as dietary minerals , essential fatty acids , or essential amino acids ( which are needed in larger amounts than vitamins ) nor the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less often ."
5857,Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present .
5858,"Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity , not their structure ."
5859,"Thus , each `` vitamin '' refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin ."
5860,"Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin `` generic descriptor '' title , such as `` vitamin A `` , which includes the compounds retinal , retinol , and four known carotenoids ."
5861,"Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body , and are sometimes inter-convertible to one another , as well ."
5862,Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions .
5863,"Some have hormone-like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D ) , or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation ( such as some forms of vitamin A ) ."
5864,"Others function as antioxidants ( e.g. , vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C ) ."
5865,"The largest number of vitamins ( such as B complex vitamins ) function as precursors for enzyme cofactors , that help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism ."
5866,"In this role , vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups : For example , biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids ."
5867,"Vitamins may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes , detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules ."
5868,"For example , folic acid may carry methyl , formyl , and methylene groups in the cell ."
5869,"Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins ' best-known function , the other vitamin functions are equally important ."
5870,"Until the mid-1930s , when the first commercial yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold , vitamins were obtained solely through food intake , and changes in diet ( which , for example , could occur during a particular growing season ) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested ."
5871,"However , vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives , since the middle of the 20th century ."

5899,"The earliest mention of Dubai is in 1095 AD , and the earliest recorded settlement in the region dates from 1799 ."
5900,"The Sheikhdom of Dubai was formally established in 1833 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Butti Al-Maktoum when he persuaded around 800 members of his tribe of the Bani Yas , living in what was then the Second Saudi State and now part of Saudi Arabia , to follow him to the Dubai Creek by the Abu Falasa clan of the Bani Yas ."
5901,It remained under the tribe 's control when the United Kingdom assumed protection of the Sheikhdom in 1892 and joined the nascent United Arab Emirates upon independence in 1971 as the country 's second emirate .
5902,"Its strategic geographic location made the town an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century , Dubai was already an important regional port ."

5918,"In the context of Earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's World Ocean – they are , in descending order of area , the Pacific , Atlantic , Indian , Southern ( Antarctic ) , and Arctic Oceans ."
5919,"The word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water ( possibly a division of the World Ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land ."
5920,Earth is the only planet known to have an ocean ( or any large amounts of open liquid water ) .
5921,"Approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the Earth 's surface ."
5922,"In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the Earth 's water ."
5923,"Oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored ."
5924,"Because it is the principal component of Earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns ."
5925,The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an average depth of .
5926,"It is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist ."
5927,"The origin of Earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life ."
5928,Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .
5929,"The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System ."
5930,"Early in their geologic histories , Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans ."
5931,"The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water , though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus ."
5932,"Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice ."
5933,"Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth ."
5934,The Solar System 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .

5945,He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records .
5946,"His energized interpretations of songs , many from African-American sources , and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and controversial ."
5947,"In November 1956 , he made his film debut in Love Me Tender ."
5948,"Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work ."

5963,Fluorescent minerals emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light
5964,Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation .
5965,It is a form of luminescence .
5966,"In most cases , the emitted light has a longer wavelength , and therefore lower energy , than the absorbed radiation ."
5967,"However , when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense , it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons ; this two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation ."
5968,"The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation , termed `` resonance fluorescence '' ."
5969,"The most striking examples of fluorescence occur when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum , and thus invisible to the human eye , and the emitted light is in the visible region ."
5970,"Fluorescence has many practical applications , including mineralogy , gemology , chemical sensors ( fluorescence spectroscopy ) , fluorescent labelling , dyes , biological detectors , and , most commonly , fluorescent lamps ."
5971,"Informal logic , intuitively , refers to the principles of logic and logical thought outside of a formal setting ."
5972,"However , perhaps because of the informal in the title , the precise definition of informal logic is a matter of some dispute ."
5973,"Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair define informal logic as `` a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards , criteria , procedures for the analysis , interpretation , evaluation , criticism and construction of argumentation . ''"
5974,This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts .
5975,"Informal logic is associated with ( informal ) fallacies , critical thinking , the Thinking Skills Movement and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as argumentation theory ."
5976,Frans H. van Eemeren writes that the label `` informal logic '' covers a `` collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of argumentation than formal logic . ''

5979,"The Great Depression began in August of 1929 , when the United States economy first went into an economic recession ."
5980,"Although the country spent two months with declining GDP , it was not until the Wall Street Crash of October , 1929 that the effects of a declining economy were felt , and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued ."
5981,"The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment , poverty , low profits , deflation , plunging farm incomes , and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement ."
5982,"Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial , the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future ."
5983,"The usual explanations include numerous factors , especially high consumer debt , ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors , and the lack of high-growth new industries , all interacting to create a downward economic spiral of reduced spending , falling confidence , and lowered production ."
5984,"Industries that suffered the most included construction , agriculture as dust-bowl conditions persisted in the agricultural heartland , shipping , mining , and logging as well as durable goods like automobiles and appliances that could be postponed ."
5985,"The economy reached bottom in the winter of 1932–33 ; then came four years of very rapid growth until 1937 , when the Recession of 1937 brought back 1934 levels of unemployment ."
5986,The Depression caused major political changes in America .
5987,"Three years into the depression , Herbert Hoover lost the 1932 presidential election to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a sweeping landslide ."
5988,"Roosevelt 's economic recovery plan , the New Deal , instituted unprecedented programs for relief , recovery and reform , and brought about a major realignment of American politics ."
5989,The Depression also resulted in an increase of emigration of people to other countries for the first time in American history .
5990,"For example , some immigrants went back to their native countries , and some native US citizens went to Canada , Australia , and South Africa ."
5991,"It also resulted in the mass migration of people from badly hit areas in the Great Plains and the South to places such as California and the North , respectively ( see Okies and the Great Migration of African Americans ) ."
5992,Racial tensions also increased during this time .
5993,"By the 1940s immigration had returned back to normal , and emigration declined ."
5994,"A well-known example of an emigrant was Frank McCourt , who went to Ireland , as recounted in his book Angela 's Ashes ."
5995,"The memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns , such as the use of stimulus packages , Keynesian economics , and Social Security ."
5996,"It also shaped modern American literature , resulting in famous novels such as John Steinbeck 's `` The Grapes of Wrath `` and `` Of Mice and Men `` ."

6091,Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th century .
6092,Joseph Proust 's law of definite proportions and John Dalton 's atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier .
6093,Lavoisier 's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston .
6094,"The law of conservation of mass , or principle of mass conservation , states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy ( both of which have mass ) , the mass of the system must remain constant over time , as system mass can not change quantity if it is not added or removed ."
6095,"Hence , the quantity of mass is `` conserved '' over time ."
6096,"The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed , although it may be rearranged in space , or the entities associated with it may be changed in form , as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed ."
6097,"The law implies ( requires ) that during any chemical reaction , nuclear reaction , or radioactive decay in an isolated system , the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products ."
6098,"The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry , mechanics , and fluid dynamics ."
6099,"Historically , mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century , and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry ."
6100,"The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory , but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations , even in modern practice ."
6101,"In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved , the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important , since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e . those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment ."
6102,"In this circumstance , the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation , which is the first law of thermodynamics ."
6103,"By contrast , for a thermodynamically closed system ( i.e. , one which is closed to exchanges of matter , but open to exchanges of non-material energy , such as heat and work , with the surroundings ) mass is ( usually ) only approximately conserved ."
6104,"The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory , although the change is usually small , since relatively large amounts of such energy ( by comparison with ordinary experience ) carry only a small amount of mass ( again by ordinary standards of measurement ) ."
6105,"In special relativity , mass is not converted to energy , since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into , or out of , a system ."
6106,"However , certain types of matter ( a different concept ) may be converted to energy , so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process ."
6107,"However , if such energy is removed from systems , they must lose the mass that is associated with it ."
6108,"In general relativity , mass ( and energy ) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept , subject to different definitions , and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space ."
6109,"For a discussion , see mass in general relativity ."

6115,"8-inch , -inch ( full height ) , and -inch drives"
6116,"A 3.5-inch diskette 's `` floppy '' magnetic material , removed from its housing"
6117,"A floppy disk , or diskette , is a disk storage medium composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium , sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles ."
6118,They are read and written by a floppy disk drive ( FDD ) .
6119,"Floppy disks , initially as media and later in and 3.5-inch ( 90 mm ) sizes , were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s well into the first decade of the 21st century ."
6120,"By 2010 , computer motherboards were rarely manufactured with floppy drive support ; `` floppies could be used as an external USB drive , but `` , 8 `` , and non-standard drives could only be handled by old equipment ."
6121,"While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses , especially with legacy industrial computer equipment , they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity , such as USB flash drives , portable external hard disk drives , optical discs , memory cards , and computer networks ."
6122,An animated diagram of a cutter
6123,"In baseball , a cutter , or cut fastball , is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher 's glove side as it reaches home plate ."
6124,"This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball , as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball ."
6125,Some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs .
6126,A common technique used to throw a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand .
6127,"When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch , it often results in soft contact and an easy out , due to the pitch 's movement keeping the ball away from the bat 's sweet spot ."
6128,The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower than a pitcher 's four-seam fastball .
6129,"In 2010 , the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph ; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph ."
6130,`` What It Takes '' is a power ballad by American hard rock band Aerosmith .

6132,It was released in 1990 as the third single from Aerosmith 's critically and commercially successful 1989 album Pump .
6133,"In the video The Making of Pump , A & R man John Kalodner described the song as `` a masterpiece '' ."
6134,"During live performances , Tyler sings the first verse a cappella and belts out one of his signature screams right before the chorus ."
6135,The album version of the song is followed by an untitled hidden track .

6173,"The humanities are academic disciplines that study human culture , using methods that are primarily analytical , critical , or speculative , and having a significant historical element , as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences ."
6174,"The humanities include ancient and modern languages , literature , philosophy , religion , and visual and performing arts such as music and theatre ."
6175,"The humanities that are also regarded as social sciences include history , anthropology , area studies , communication studies , cultural studies , law , economics and linguistics ."
6176,Scholars working in the humanities are sometimes described as `` humanists '' .
6177,"However , that term also describes the philosophical position of humanism , which some `` antihumanist `` scholars in the humanities reject ."
6178,"Some secondary schools offer humanities classes , usually consisting of English literature , global studies , and art ."
6179,"Human disciplines like history , cultural anthropology and psychoanalysis study subject matters to which the experimental method does not apply , and they have access instead to the comparative method and comparative research ."
6180,The 2005 Blue Room Christmas Tree
6181,"The White House Christmas Tree , also known as the Blue Room Christmas Tree , is the official indoor Christmas tree at the residence of the President of the United States , the White House ."
6182,The first indoor Christmas tree was installed in the White House sometime in the 19th century ( there are varying claims as to the exact year ) and since 1961 the tree has had a themed motif at the discretion of the First Lady of the United States .
6183,The President of the United States of America ( POTUS ) is the head of state and head of government of the United States .
6184,The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .
6185,"Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and charges him with the execution of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory , and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers , with the advice and consent of the Senate ."
6186,"The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances ."
6187,"Since the founding of the United States , the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially and each modern president , despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills , is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States ."
6188,The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world .
6189,"The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term , and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers , the other being the Vice President of the United States ."
6190,"The Twenty-second Amendment , adopted in 1951 , prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term ."
6191,"It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president , or acting president , for more than two years of another person 's term as president ."

6195,Senses are physiological capacities of organisms that provide data for perception .
6196,"The senses and their operation , classification , and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields , most notably neuroscience , cognitive psychology ( or cognitive science ) , and philosophy of perception ."
6197,"The nervous system has a specific sensory system or organ , dedicated to each sense ."
6198,Humans have a multitude of senses .
6199,"Sight ( ophthalmoception ) , hearing ( audioception ) , taste ( gustaoception ) , smell ( olfacoception or olfacception ) , and touch ( tactioception ) are the five traditionally recognized ."
6200,"While the ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by the traditional senses exists , including temperature ( thermoception ) , kinesthetic sense ( proprioception ) , pain ( nociception ) , balance ( equilibrioception ) , acceleration ( kinesthesioception ) , and various internal stimuli ( e.g . the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood ) , only a small number of these can safely be classified as separate senses in and of themselves ."
6201,"What constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate , leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a sense is ."
6202,"Animals also have receptors to sense the world around them , with degrees of capability varying greatly between species ."
6203,"Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell , while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses ."
6204,Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways .
6205,"Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans can not , with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents ."
6206,Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom .
6207,They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms .
6208,"Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization ."
6209,"As of 2008 , at least 43,678 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however , there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900 ."
6210,"Anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel ."
6211,"Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae ."
6212,"In all except the most primitive group , the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax ."
6213,"Unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure ."
6214,Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen .
6215,"Spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used ."
6216,"It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders ."
6217,"Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets ."
6218,"True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order , the Mesothelae ."
6219,"The main groups of modern spiders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appeared in the Triassic period , before ."
6220,"A herbivorous species , Bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008 , but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders , although a few large species also take birds and lizards ."
6221,"Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs , lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection , or running it down ."
6222,"Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations , but the active hunters have acute vision , and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones ."
6223,"Spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids , and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws ."
6224,Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females .
6225,"Males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans ."
6226,"Females weave silk egg-cases , each of which may contain hundreds of eggs ."
6227,"Females of many species care for their young , for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them ."
6228,"A minority of species are social , building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals ."
6229,"Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration , as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing ."
6230,"Although most spiders live for at most two years , tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity ."
6231,"While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans , scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides ."
6232,"Spider silk provides a combination of lightness , strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials , and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories ."
6233,"As a result of their wide range of behaviors , spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience , cruelty and creative powers ."
6234,"Grey 's Anatomy is an American television medical drama that premiered on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) , as a mid-season replacement on March 27 , 2005 ."

6253,"On May 11 , 2012 , the series was renewed for a ninth season , which premiered on September 27 , 2012 ."
6254,Schizophrenia ( or ) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses .
6255,"Common symptoms include auditory hallucinations , paranoid or bizarre delusions , or disorganized speech and thinking , and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction ."
6256,"The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood , with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3–0.7 % ."
6257,Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient 's reported experiences .
6258,"Genetics , early environment , neurobiology , and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors ; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms ."
6259,"Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology , although no single isolated organic cause has been found ."
6260,The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes .
6261,"Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek roots skhizein ( σχίζειν , `` to split '' ) and phrēn , phren- ( φρήν , φρεν- ; `` mind '' ) , schizophrenia does not imply a `` split personality '' , or `` multiple personality disorder '' ( which is known these days as dissociative identity disorder ) —a condition with which it is often confused in public perception ."
6262,"Rather , the term means a `` splitting of mental functions '' , because of the symptomatic presentation of the illness ."
6263,"The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication , which primarily suppresses dopamine ( and sometimes serotonin ) receptor activity ."
6264,Psychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment .
6265,"In more serious cases—where there is risk to self and others— involuntary hospitalization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were ."
6266,"The disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition , but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion ."
6267,"People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ( comorbid ) conditions , including major depression and anxiety disorders ; the lifetime occurrence of substance use disorder is almost 50 % ."
6268,"Social problems , such as long-term unemployment , poverty , and homelessness are common ."
6269,"The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years less than those without , the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate ( about 5 % ) ."
6270,"Paul Leslie Snider ( April 15 , 1951–August 14 , 1980 ) was the estranged husband and manager of Playboy model Dorothy Stratten , whom he murdered before killing himself the same day ."
6271,"The Epic of Gilgamesh , an epic poem from Mesopotamia , is amongst the earliest surviving works of literature ."
6272,"The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five independent Sumerian poems about 'Bilgamesh ' ( Sumerian for Gilgamesh ) , king of Uruk ."
6273,Four of these were used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian .
6274,"This first combined epic , known as the `` Old Babylonian '' version , dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit , Shūtur eli sharrī ( `` Surpassing All Other Kings '' ) ."
6275,Only a few fragments of it have survived .
6276,The later `` Standard Babylonian '' version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru ( `` He who Saw the Deep '' ) .
6277,"Fragments of approximately two thirds of this longer , twelve-tablet version have been recovered ."
6278,Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal .
6279,The story centers on a friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu .
6280,Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh 's equal to distract him from oppressing the people of Uruk .
6281,"Together , they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian ."
6282,"Later they kill the Bull of Heaven , which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances ."
6283,"As a punishment for these actions , the gods sentence Enkidu to death ."
6284,"The second half of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh 's distress at Enkidu 's death , and his quest for immortality ."
6285,"In order to learn the secret of eternal life , Gilgamesh undertakes a long and perilous journey ."
6286,He learns that `` The life that you are seeking you will never find .
6287,"When the gods created man they allotted to him death , but life they retained in their own keeping . ''"
6288,"This quote was originally attributed to Siduri in the Old Babylonian version of the epic , and then attributed to the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim in the Akkadian version of the epic ."
6289,"Nevertheless , Gilgamesh 's fame lived on after his death , because of his great building projects , and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood ."
6290,"The story has been translated into many different languages , and Gilgamesh has since become adapted in works of popular fiction ."
6291,A eukaryote ( or ) is an organism whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes .
6292,Eukaryotes may more formally be referred to as the taxon Eukarya or Eukaryota .
6293,"The defining membrane-bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells is the nucleus , or nuclear envelope , within which the genetic material is carried ."
6294,"The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name , which comes from the Greek ( eu , `` good '' ) and ( karyon , `` nut '' or `` kernel '' ) ."
6295,"Most eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria , chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus ."
6296,"All large complex organisms are eukaryotes , including animals , plants and fungi ."
6297,The group also includes many unicellular organisms .
6298,Cell division in eukaryotes is different from that in organisms without a nucleus ( Prokaryote ) .
6299,"It involves separating the duplicated chromosomes , through movements directed by microtubules ."
6300,There are two types of division processes .
6301,"In mitosis , one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells ."
6302,"In meiosis , which is required in sexual reproduction , one diploid cell ( having two instances of each chromosome , one from each parent ) undergoes recombination of each pair of parental chromosomes , and then two stages of cell division , resulting in four haploid cells ( gametes ) ."
6303,"Each gamete has just one complement of chromosomes , each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes ."
6304,"Eukaryota appears to be monophyletic , and so makes up one of the three domains of life ."
6305,"The two other domains , Bacteria and Archaea , are prokaryotes and have none of the above features ."
6306,Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things ; even in a human body there are 10 times more microbes than human cells .
6307,"However , due to their much larger size their collective worldwide biomass is estimated at about equal to that of prokaryotes ."
6308,They are considered to have first developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago .
6309,"The use of Internet services or software with Internet access to defraud victims or to otherwise take advantage of them , for example by stealing personal information , which can even lead to identity theft ."
6310,A very common form of Internet fraud is the distribution of rogue security software .
6311,"Internet services can be used to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims , to conduct fraudulent transactions , or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme ."
6312,"Internet fraud can occur in chat rooms , email , message boards , or on websites ."
6313,"The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) is a NATO -led security mission in Afghanistan that was established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386 , as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement ."
6314,Its main purpose is to train the Afghan National Security Forces ( ANSF ) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions but is also engaged in the 2001-present war with insurgent groups .
6315,"ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban , al Qaeda and factional warlords , so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai ."
6316,"In October 2003 , the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan , and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country ."
6317,"From 2006 to 2011 , ISAF had been involved in increasingly more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan ."

6322,Cocaine ( benzoylmethylecgonine ) ( INN ) is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant .
6323,"The name comes from `` coca '' and the alkaloid suffix -ine , forming cocaine ."
6324,"It is a stimulant , an appetite suppressant , and a topical anesthetic ."
6325,"Biologically , cocaine acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor , also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor ( TRI ) ."
6326,It is addictive because of its effect on the mesolimbic reward pathway .
6327,"Unlike most molecules , cocaine has pockets with both high hydrophilic and lipophilic efficiency , violating the rule of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance ."
6328,This causes it to cross the blood–brain barrier far better than other psychoactive chemicals and may even induce blood-brain barrier breakdown .
6329,"It is illegal to possess , produce , or distribute cocaine for non-medicinal and non-government-sanctioned purposes in almost every country ."

6338,The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives ( or Speaker of the House ) is the presiding officer of the chamber .
6339,"The office was established in 1789 by Article I , Section 2 of the United States Constitution , which states in part , `` The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker ... ''"
6340,"The current Speaker is John Boehner , a Republican who represents Ohio 's 8th congressional district ."
6341,"The Constitution does not require that the Speaker be a Member of Congress , but no non-member has ever been elected to the office ."
6342,"The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession , after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate ."
6343,"Unlike some Westminster system parliaments , in which the office of Speaker is considered non-partisan , in the United States the Speaker of the House is a leadership position and the office-holder actively works to set the majority party 's legislative agenda ."
6344,"The Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates , instead delegating the duty to members of the House from the majority party ."
6345,"Aside from duties relating to heading the House and the majority political party , the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions , and represents his or her Congressional district ."

6350,`` Simple gravity pendulum '' model assumes no friction or air resistance .
6351,An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors
6352,A pendulum is a weight suspended from a so that it can swing freely .
6353,"When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position , it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position ."
6354,"When released , the restoring force combined with the pendulum 's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position , swinging back and forth ."
6355,"The time for one complete cycle , a left swing and a right swing , is called the period ."
6356,A pendulum swings with a specific period which depends ( mainly ) on its length .
6357,"From its discovery around 1602 by Galileo Galilei the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping , and was the world 's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s ."
6358,"Pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks , and are used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers ."
6359,"Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geophysical surveys , and even as a standard of length ."
6360,"The word 'pendulum ' is new Latin , from the Latin pendulus , meaning 'hanging ' ."
6361,The simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum .
6362,"This is a weight ( or bob ) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a , without friction ."
6363,"When given an initial push , it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude ."
6364,"Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag , so the amplitude of their swings declines ."
6365,"The First Battle of Bull Run , also known as First Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 , in Prince William County , Virginia , near the city of Manassas ."
6366,It was the first major land battle of the American Civil War .
6367,"Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion ."
6368,"Yielding to political pressure , Brig . Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig . Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction ."
6369,"McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage ."
6370,Confederate reinforcements under Brig . Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad and the course of the battle quickly changed .
6371,"A brigade of Virginians under a relatively unknown colonel from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood their ground and Jackson received his famous nickname , `` Stonewall Jackson '' ."
6372,"The Confederates then launched a strong counterattack , and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire , many panicked and it turned into a rout as McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington , D.C ."
6373,"Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties , and realized the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated ."

6375,"Weather is the state of the atmosphere , to the degree that it is hot or cold , wet or dry , calm or stormy , clear or cloudy ."
6376,"Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere , just below the stratosphere ."
6377,"Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity , whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time ."
6378,"When used without qualification , `` weather '' is understood to be the weather of Earth ."
6379,Weather is driven by air pressure ( temperature and moisture ) differences between one place and another .
6380,"These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot , which varies by latitude from the tropics ."
6381,The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream .
6382,"Weather systems in the mid-latitudes , such as extratropical cyclones , are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow ."
6383,"Because the Earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane , sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year ."
6384,"On Earth 's surface , temperatures usually range ±40 °C ( −40 °F to 100 °F ) annually ."
6385,"Over thousands of years , changes in Earth 's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change ."
6386,Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences .
6387,Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating .
6388,Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location .
6389,"The atmosphere is a chaotic system , so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole ."
6390,"Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history , and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns ."
6391,Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth .
6392,"A famous landmark in the Solar System , Jupiter 's Great Red Spot , is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years ."
6393,"However , weather is not limited to planetary bodies ."
6394,"A star 's corona is constantly being lost to space , creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System ."

6403,"In many countries English is the dominant language , but does not have official status ."
6404,"In Australia , English is spoken by the vast majority of the population and is the only language used in government institutions , but Australia does not have an official language ."
6405,"The case is the same in the United Kingdom and the United States , though many states and regions within the U.S. do have English as an official language ."
6406,"English is the dominant language of New Zealand and an official language of Canada ( along with French ) , India ( along with Hindi and several other languages ) , Ireland ( along with Irish ) , and the Philippines ( along with Tagalog ) ."

6410,"Notable exceptions include Rwanda , which was a former Belgian colony and Eritrea , which was an Italian colony where the British Empire spanned its control only in World War II and shortly after ( 1941-1952 ) ."
6411,India 's linguistic picture is complex .
6412,"According to the Constitution of India , `` Hindi in the Devanagari script '' is the official language of the union ; and English the 'subsidiary official language ' ; however , English is mandated for the authoritative texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions and ( along with Hindi ) is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament ."
6413,"English is used almost exclusively for higher education , business and science ."

6424,"Southern Cone ( , ) is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America , south of the Tropic of Capricorn ."
6425,"Although geographically this includes Southern and part of Southeast ( São Paulo ) of Brazil , in terms of political geography the Southern cone has traditionally comprised Argentina , Chile , Paraguay , and Uruguay ."
6426,"In the narrowest sense , it only covers Argentina , Chile and Uruguay , bounded on the north by the states of Brazil , Paraguay , Bolivia and Peru , on the west by the Pacific Ocean , and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans , which it is the closest continental area of Antarctica ( 1000 km ) ."
6427,"High life expectancy , the highest Human Development Index of Latin America , high Standard of living , significant participation in the global markets and the emerging economy of its members make the Southern Cone the most prosperous macro-region in South America ."
6428,"For multi-event athletic competitions see Track and Field Competitions , section `` Meetings '' ."
6429,Meetings are sometimes held around conference tables .
6430,"In a meeting , two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics , often in a formal setting ."
6431,"An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game , is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary ."
6432,This is approximately the halfway point of the game .
6433,"In the case of inclement weather , any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed , with the result being final , and all records and statistics counted ."
6434,"A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game ( to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage ) , or is simply canceled and replayed from the start ."
6435,( This depends on the rules of each individual league . )
6436,"In either case , no statistics are counted until the game becomes official ."
6437,"Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long , the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game ."
6438,"If the visiting team is leading , or the game is tied , the end of the fifth inning marks this point ."
6439,"If the home team ( which bats last ) is already ahead in the score , and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning , then 41⁄2 innings ( i.e. , the middle of the fifth ) is considered an official game ."
6440,"The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning , since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth ."
6441,"In nearly all cases , the `` official game '' status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets ."
6442,"If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official , fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or ( in most cases ) any other available game of their choice ."
6443,"If a game is halted after it becomes official , the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given ."
6444,"The `` official game '' statistic received some attention during the 1995 season , when Cal Ripken , Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by Lou Gehrig ."
6445,Large numbers were hung on the side of the B & O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken 's streak .
6446,"Each day , a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official ( since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point ) ."
6447,"A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums ( including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003 , Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005 , and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008 ) ; as each game became official , the team would unveil a new ( lower ) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium ."
6448,A telephone number or phone number is a sequence of digits used to call from one telephone line to another in a public switched telephone network .
6449,"When telephone numbers were invented , they were short — as few as one , two or three digits — and were given orally to a switchboard operator ."
6450,"As phone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass the world , telephone numbers have become longer ."
6451,"In addition to telephones , they now access other devices , such as computers and fax machines ."
6452,The number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call .
6453,Each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched telephone network .
6454,Most countries use fixed length numbers ( for normal lines at least ) and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number .
6455,It is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used .
6456,These `` shorthand '' or `` speed calling '' numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected .
6457,"Some special services have their own short numbers ( e.g. , 1-1-9 , 9-1-1 , 0-0-0 , 9-9-9 , 1-1-1 , and 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and Sri Lanka ; Canada and the United States ; Australia ; the United Kingdom , Ireland , South Africa , Poland , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Morocco , Macao , Bahrain , Qatar , Bangladesh , Botswana , Ghana , Kenya , Hong Kong , Malaysia , Mauritius , Singapore , Zimbabwe , Trinidad , Tobago ; New Zealand ; Kuwait and the European Union , respectively . )"
6458,Many systems also allow calls within a local area to be made without dialing the local area code .
6459,"For example , a phone number in North America will start with three numbers ( such as 661 ) , which is the area code , followed by seven digits split into sections of three and four ( such as 550-1212 ) , which is the local number ."
6460,"Some areas now have mandatory ten-digit dialing in place , even for local calls ."
6461,"Most telephone networks today ( exceptions being private intercom and secure phone networks ) are interconnected in the international telephone network , where the format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T in the recommendation E.164 ."
6462,"This specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter , and begin with a country prefix ."
6463,"For most countries , this is followed by an area code or city code and the subscriber number , which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange ."
6464,"ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print , starting with a plus sign ( `` + '' ) and the country code ."
6465,"When calling an international number from a fixed line phone , the + must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from ."
6466,Some mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly .
6467,"The format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nation 's respective government , either directly or by sponsored organizations ( such as NANPA overseen by NeuStar Inc. ) ."
6468,"Before a telephone call is connected , the telephone number must be dialed by the calling party or Caller ."
6469,The called party might have equipment that presents caller ID before the call is answered .
6470,A collection agency is a business that pursues payments of debts owed by individuals or businesses .
6471,Most collection agencies operate as agents of creditors and collect debts for a fee or percentage of the total amount owed .
6472,There are many types of collection agencies .
6473,First-party agencies are oftentimes subsidiaries of the original company the debt is owed to .
6474,Third-party agencies are separate companies contracted by a company to collect debts on their behalf for a fee .
6475,"Debt buyers purchase the debt at a percentage of its value , then attempt to collect it ."
6476,Each country has its own rules and regulations regarding them .

6492,"1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta ( 1st SFOD-D ) , popularly known as Delta Force , is one of the United States ' four secretive tier-one counter-terrorism and Special Mission Units ."
6493,It was formerly listed as the Combat Applications Group by the Department of Defense but has since been officially re-designated the Army Compartmented Elements ( ACE ) .
6494,"While 1st SFOD-D is administratively supported by USASOC , it falls under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command ."
6495,"Delta Force and its Navy counterpart , the Naval Special Warfare Development Group , are the United States military 's primary counter-terrorism units ."
6496,"Delta Force 's primary tasks are counter-terrorism , direct action , and national intervention operations , although it is an extremely versatile group capable of conducting many types of covert missions , including , but not limited to , hostage rescues and raids ."
6497,The Central Intelligence Agency 's highly secretive Special Activities Division ( SAD ) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group ( SOG ) often works with – and recruits – operators from Delta Force .
6498,"Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay , in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle , and thereby transforms ( or 'decays ' ) into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less ."
6499,Many other types of decays are possible .
6500,"Radioactive decay , also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity , is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation ."
6501,"A material that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation — which includes the emission of energetic alpha particles , beta particles , and gamma rays — is considered radioactive ."
6502,There are many different types of radioactive decay ( see table below ) .
6503,"A decay , or loss of energy , results when an atom with one type of nucleus , called the parent radionuclide , transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state , or to a different nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons ."
6504,Either of these products is named the daughter nuclide .
6505,"In some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements , and thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation ( creation of an atom of a new element ) ."
6506,"The first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay ."
6507,Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle ( helium nucleus ) .
6508,"This is the most common process of emitting nucleons , but in rarer types of decays , nuclei can eject protons , or specific nuclei of other elements ( in the process called cluster decay ) ."
6509,"Beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of neutrino , in a process that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way around ."
6510,"The nucleus may capture an orbiting electron , converting a proton into a neutron ( electron capture ) ."
6511,All of these processes result in nuclear transmutation .
6512,"By contrast , there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutation ."
6513,"The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in gamma decay , or used to eject an orbital electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion ."
6514,"Radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons , and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to another ."
6515,"One type of radioactive decay results in products which are not defined , but appear in a range of `` pieces '' of the original nucleus ."
6516,This decay is called spontaneous fission .
6517,"This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two ( and occasionally three ) smaller daughter nuclei , and usually emits gamma rays , neutrons , or other particles as a consequence ."
6518,"Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e. , random ) process at the level of single atoms , in that , according to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay ."
6519,"However , the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time ."
6520,"For a large number of atoms , the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides ( or equivalently from the half-lifes ) ."
6521,Waxing is a form of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root .
6522,"New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for two to eight weeks , although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week ."
6523,"Almost any area of the body can be waxed , including eyebrows , face , bikini area , legs , arms , back , abdomen and feet ."
6524,There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair .
6525,Strip waxing is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin .
6526,A cloth or paper strip is then pressed on the top and ripped off the direction of hair growth .
6527,This removes the wax along with the hair .
6528,"Strip wax can also be made at home using lemon juice , water , sugar and honey ."
6529,Hot waxing utilizes Hot wax ( as opposed to strip wax ) .
6530,"In this case , the wax is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips ."
6531,"The wax then hardens when it cools , thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths ."
6532,This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin .

6534,Ancient Roman culture existed throughout the almost 1200-year history of the civilization of Ancient Rome .
6535,"The term refers to the culture of the Roman Republic , later the Roman Empire , which , at its peak , covered an area from Lowland Scotland and Morocco to the Euphrates ."
6536,"Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome , its famed seven hills , and its monumental structures such as the Flavian Amphitheatre ( now called the Colosseum ) , the Forum of Trajan , and the Pantheon ."
6537,"The city also had several theaters , gymnasiums , and many taverns , baths , and brothels ."
6538,"Throughout the territory under ancient Rome 's control , residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas , and in the capital city of Rome , there were imperial residences on the elegant Palatine Hill , from which the word palace is derived ."
6539,"The vast majority of the population lived in the city center , packed into insulae ( apartment blocks ) ."
6540,"The city of Rome was the largest megalopolis of that time , with a population that may well have exceeded one million people , with a high end estimate of 3.6 million and a low end estimate of 450,000 ."
6541,"Historical estimates indicate that around 30 percent of the population under the city 's jurisdiction lived in innumerable urban centers , with population of at least 10,000 and several military settlements , a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards ."
6542,"The most urbanized part of the Empire was Italy , which had an estimated rate of urbanization of 32 % , the same rate of urbanization of England in 1800 ."
6543,"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum , temples and the same type of buildings , on a smaller scale , as found in Rome ."
6544,"The large urban population required an endless supply of food which was a complex logistical task , including acquiring , transporting , storing and distribution of food for Rome and other urban centers ."
6545,"Italian farms supplied vegetables and fruits , but fish and meat were luxuries ."
6546,"Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and oil were imported from Hispania , Gaul and Africa ."
6547,"There was a very large amount of commerce between the provinces of the Roman Empire , since its transportation technology was very efficient ."
6548,The average costs of transport and the technology were comparable with 18th-century Europe .
6549,The later city of Rome did not fill the space within its ancient Aurelian walls until after 1870 .
6550,Eighty percent of the population under the jurisdiction of ancient Rome lived in the countryside in settlements with less than 10 thousand inhabitants .
6551,Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers .
6552,The plight of rural slaves was generally worse than their counterparts working in urban aristocratic households .
6553,To stimulate a higher labor productivity most landlords freed a large number of slaves and many received wages .

6568,"A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight ."
6569,Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
6570,"In temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants to be dormant ."
6571,"During May , June and July , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun ."
6572,"The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November , December and January ."
6573,It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
6574,"However , due to seasonal lag , June , July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December , January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere ."
6575,"In temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) ."
6576,"However , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four ."
6577,"Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season ."

6681,Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language
6682,Energy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to another .
6683,"In physics , the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system , without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by Entropy ."
6684,"Changes in total energy of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them , as energy is a quantity which is conserved , according to the first law of thermodynamics ."
6685,"According to special relativity , changes in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the system 's mass , and the total amount of mass of a system is a measure of its energy ."
6686,"Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state , or a different type of energy ."
6687,Energy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work .
6688,"Energy may be used in natural processes or machines , or else to provide some service to society ( such as heat , light , or motion ) ."
6689,"For example , an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat , which is then transformed into the propulsive energy ( kinetic energy that moves a vehicle ) ."
6690,A solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computer .
6691,"The generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another , is a transducer ."
6692,"In general , most types of energy , save for thermal energy , may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energy ."
6693,"Sometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 % , such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum , or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object , in space ."
6694,Conversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency ( many types of friction do this ) .
6695,"Exceptions for perfect conversion efficiency ( even for isolated systems ) occur when energy has already been partly distributed among many available quantum states for a collection of particles , which are freely allowed to explore any state of momentum and position ( phase space ) ."
6696,"In such circumstances , a measure called Entropy , or evening-out of energy distribution in such states , dictates that future states of the system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution ."
6697,"( There is no way , taking the universe as a whole , to collect energy into fewer states , once it has spread to them ) ."
6698,"A consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy , since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states ."
6699,"Such energy is sometimes considered `` degraded energy , '' because it is not entirely usable ."
6700,"The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that , for this reason , thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 % , only if the entropy ( even-ness or disorder ) of the universe is increased by other means , to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content ."
6701,"Otherwise , only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy ( and thus , useful work ) , since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature , in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy ."
6702,This is the complete list of the ratified and unratified amendments to the United States Constitution which received the approval of the United States Congress .
6703,"Twenty-seven amendments have been ratified since the original signing of the Constitution , the first ten of which are known collectively as the Bill of Rights ."
6704,The procedure for amending the United States Constitution is governed by Article V of the original text .
6705,"There have been many other proposals for amendments to the United States Constitution introduced in Congress , but not submitted to the states ."
6706,"Before an amendment can take effect , it must be proposed to the states by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or by a convention ( known as an Article V convention ) called by two-thirds of the states , and ratified by three-fourths of the states or by three-fourths of conventions thereof , the method of ratification being determined by Congress at the time of proposal ."
6707,"To date , no convention for proposing amendments has been called by the states , and only once—in 1933 for the ratification of the twenty-first amendment —has the convention method of ratification been employed ."

6717,"Sociology is the scientific study of human society and its origins , development , organizations , and institutions ."
6718,"It is a social science which uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about human social activity , structures , and functions ."
6719,"A goal for many sociologists is to conduct research which may be applied directly to social policy and welfare , while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes ."
6720,Subject matter ranges from the micro level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure .
6721,"The traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification , social class , culture , race and ethnicity , gender and sexuality , social mobility , religion , secularization , law , and deviance ."
6722,"As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency , sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects , such as health , medical , military and penal institutions , the Internet , environmental sociology , political economy and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge ."
6723,The range of social scientific methods has also expanded .
6724,Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques .
6725,"The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative , hermeneutic , and philosophic approaches to the analysis of society ."
6726,"Conversely , recent decades have seen the rise of new analytically , mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques , such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis ."
6727,Sociology should not be confused with various general social studies courses which bear little relation to sociological theory or social science research methodology .
6728,Thunder is the sound caused by lightning .
6729,"Depending on the nature of the lightning and distance of the listener , thunder can range from a sharp , loud crack to a long , low rumble ( brontide ) ."
6730,The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning .
6731,"In turn , this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave , similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder , often referred to as a clap , crack , or peal of thunder ."
6732,The distance of the lightning can be calculated by the listener based on the time interval from when the lightning is seen to when the sound is heard .

6805,"Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century , the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization ."
6806,"At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters , and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a `` single effect '' or mood ."
6807,"In so doing , short stories make use of plot , resonance , and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote , yet to a far lesser degree than a novel ."
6808,"While the short story is largely distinct from the novel , authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques ."
6809,Short stories have no set length .
6810,"In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an anecdote , a short story , and a novel ."
6811,"Rather , the form 's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered , so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres , countries , eras , and commentators ."
6812,"Like the novel , the short story 's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication , and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses ."
6813,"The short story has been considered both an apprenticeship form preceding more lengthy works , and a crafted form in its own right , collected together in books of similar length , price , and distribution as novels ."
6814,Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form .
6815,They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed form .

6850,"The stars of the show were Mister Ed , a palomino horse who could `` talk '' , played by gelding Bamboo Harvester and voiced by former Western star Allan Lane ( who went uncredited for the entire length of the series ) , and his owner , an eccentric and enormously klutzy , yet friendly , architect named Wilbur Post ( Alan Young ) ."

6860,"The Rapture is a term in Christian eschatology which refers to the `` being caught up '' discussed in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 , when the `` dead in Christ '' and `` we who are alive and remain '' will be `` caught up in the clouds '' to meet `` the Lord in the air '' ."
6861,The term `` Rapture '' is used in at least two senses .
6862,"In the pre-tribulation view , a group of people will be left behind on earth after another group literally leaves `` to meet the Lord in the air . ''"
6863,"This is now the most common use of the term , especially among fundamentalist Christians and in the United States ."
6864,"The other , older use of the term `` Rapture '' is simply as a synonym for the final resurrection generally , without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 ."
6865,"This distinction is important as some types of Christianity never refer to `` the Rapture '' in religious education , but might use the older and more general sense of the word `` rapture '' in referring to what happens during the final resurrection ."
6866,"There are many views among Christians regarding the timing of Christ 's return ( including whether it will occur in one event or two ) , and various views regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4 ."
6867,"Denominations such as Roman Catholics , Orthodox Christians , Lutheran Christians , and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection , when Christ returns a single time ."
6868,They do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 .

6873,"According to the Bible , they ruled the five city-states ( the `` Philistine Pentapolis '' ) of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Ekron and Gath , from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north , but with no fixed border to the east ."
6874,The Bible paints them as the Kingdom of Israel 's most dangerous enemy .
6875,"Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC , rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC , of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total , and perhaps much less ."
6876,"Nothing is known for certain about the original language or languages of the Philistines , however they were not part of the Semitic Canaanite population ."

6887,"A standard company balance sheet has three parts : assets , liabilities and ownership equity ."
6888,"The main categories of assets are usually listed first , and typically in order of liquidity ."
6889,Assets are followed by the liabilities .
6890,"The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation , net worth must equal assets minus liabilities ."
6891,Another way to look at the same equation is that assets equals liabilities plus owner 's equity .
6892,Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed : either by borrowing money ( liability ) or by using the owner 's money ( owner 's equity ) .
6893,Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections `` balancing . ''
6894,"A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period , plus any cash in hand ."
6895,"However , many businesses are not paid immediately ; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment ."
6896,"In other words : businesses have assets and so they can not , even if they want to , immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period ."
6897,"Often , these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities , and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period ."
6898,In other words businesses also have liabilities .

6912,The ads were successful at sparking some initial interest in the team as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars .
6913,The ad mimicked the highly successful Converse ads where Larry Johnson starred as both himself and `` Gramama . ''

6991,"A new series of civil wars broke out , and the constitutional government of the Republic was never restored ."
6992,"Caesar 's adopted heir Octavian , later known as Augustus , rose to sole power , and the era of the Roman Empire began ."
6993,"Much of Caesar 's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns , and from other contemporary sources , mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust ."
6994,The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources .
6995,Caesar is deemed to be one of the greatest military commanders of history .

6998,There are hundreds of languages spoken in Nigeria .
6999,"The major languages are Yoruba , Hausa , Igbo , Edo , Fulfulde , Kanuri , and Ibibio ."
7000,"The official language of Nigeria , English , the former colonial language , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country ."
7001,"English , however , remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite , and is not widely spoken in rural areas , which comprise three quarters of the countries population ."
7002,"Nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of Africa as a whole , encompassing three major African languages families : Afroasiatic , Nilo-Saharan , and Niger–Congo ."
7003,"Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages , such as Cen Tuum , which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families ."
7004,"Daucus carota ( common names include wild carrot , ( UK ) bird 's nest , bishop 's lace , and Queen Anne 's lace ( North America ) ) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae , native to temperate regions of Europe , southwest Asia and naturalised to North America and Australia ."

7007,"She has sold 20 million albums worldwide and more 20 million singles , bringing her total sales to over 40 million records around the world ."
7008,"Furtado first gained fame with her debut album , Whoa , Nelly !"
7009,", which spawned two successful singles , `` I 'm Like a Bird `` and `` Turn Off the Light `` . ``"
7010,I 'm Like A Bird '' won a 2001 Juno Award for Single of the Year and a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance .

7017,Creatures of the Night is the tenth studio album by Kiss .
7018,"It is the band 's last album for Casablanca Records , the only label the group had ever recorded for at that point ."
7019,"The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter Neil Bogart , who had died of cancer during the recording sessions ."
7020,"It is also the band 's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member ( until 1998 's Psycho Circus ) , and its first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially uncredited lead guitarist ( Vincent would later be credited , but not featured pictorially on the cover , of 1985 's reissue of the album ) ."
7021,Touch is a crucial means of receiving information .
7022,This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people .
7023,"The somatosensory system is a diverse sensory system comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the sensory modalities such as touch , temperature , proprioception ( body position ) , and nociception ( pain ) ."
7024,"The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia , skeletal muscles , bones and joints , internal organs , and the cardiovascular system ."
7025,"While touch is considered one of the five traditional senses , the impression of touch is formed from several modalities ."
7026,"In medicine , the colloquial term `` touch '' is usually replaced with `` somatic senses '' to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved ."
7027,"Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses , with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch , proprioception and ( depending on usage ) also haptic perception ."
7028,"The system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors : thermoreceptors , nociceptors , mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors ."
7029,Transmission of information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and into the brain .
7030,Processing primarily occurs in the primary somatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex .
7031,The cortical homunculus was devised by Wilder Penfield .
7032,"At its simplest , the system works when activity in a sensory neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat ; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body—this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location ."
7033,The point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a homunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image .
7034,"This brain-surface ( `` cortical '' ) map is not immutable , however ."
7035,Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury .
7036,Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae .
7037,It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol .
7038,Magnolia is an ancient genus .
7039,"Appearing before bees did , the flowers evolved to encourage pollination by beetles ."
7040,"To avoid damage from pollinating beetles , the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough ."
7041,"Fossilised specimens of Magnolia acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago , and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae dating to 95 million years ago ."
7042,Another aspect of Magnolias that is considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals ; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals .
7043,Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea ( as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium ) .
7044,"The natural range of Magnolia species is a disjunct distribution , with a main centre in east and southeast Asia and a secondary centre in eastern North America , Central America , the West Indies , and some species in South America ."
7045,`` White Christmas '' is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting .
7046,"According to the Guinness Book of World Records , the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time , with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide ."
7047,Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song .
7048,"One story is that he wrote it in 1940 , in warm La Quinta , California , while staying at the La Quinta Hotel , a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-producer Frank Capra , although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there ."
7049,"He often stayed up all night writing — he told his secretary , `` Grab your pen and take down this song ."
7050,"I just wrote the best song I 've ever written — heck , I just wrote the best song that anybody 's ever written ! ''"
7051,Cross-country skiing ( or XC skiing ) is a form of ski touring in which participants propel themselves across snow-covered terrain using skis and poles .
7052,"The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields , primarily Northern Europe , Canada , and Alaska ."
7053,"Cross-country skiing is part of the Nordic skiing sport family , which includes ski jumping , Nordic combined ( cross-country skiing and ski jumping ) , Biathlon ( skiing and rifle marksmanship ) and ski-orienteering ( which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks ) ."
7054,"Cross-country skiing is the modern style of skiing that most resembles prehistoric skiing , particularly when done in the backcountry ."
7055,It is also related to Telemark skiing .
7056,"A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means , if you buy a Taxable product/services without paying any Sales tax to vendor , you owe use tax ."
7057,You must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered .
7058,"Use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item ( without paying sales tax ) and store it in your warehouse initially , use tax applies to that location where goods were stored ."
7059,"Later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location , you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption ."
7060,This really means that you do n't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction .
7061,It is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products/services .
7062,If vendor does n't charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate Jurisdication .
7063,Use Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is different .
7064,Use tax is also termed as `` Consumption Tax '' or `` Consumer Use Tax '' .
7065,A use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments .
7066,"It is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use , storage , or consumption in that state ( not for resale ) , regardless of where the purchase took place ."
7067,"If a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state , full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction ."
7068,The use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home state 's sales tax .
7069,"Usually , this is due to out-of-state purchases , as well as ordering items through the mail , by phone , or over the Internet from other states ."
7070,The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed ( if any ) had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence .
7071,"For example , a resident of Massachusetts , with a 6.25 % `` sales and use tax '' on certain goods and services , purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use , storage or other consumption in Massachusetts ."
7072,"Under New Hampshire law , the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods , but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax ."
7073,"If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase , whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted ( as a tax credit ) from the 6.25 % owed for subsequent use , storage or consumption in Massachusetts ."
7074,"With few exceptions , no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state , meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax ."
7075,The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods .
7076,"The assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually , but some states require a monthly payment ."
7077,"For example , where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state , Vermont law requires filing a tax return ( Form SU-452 and payment ) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $ 50 late fee , a 5 % penalty per month , to a maximum of 25 % , plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties ."
7078,"Typical exemptions include purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental agencies , purchases for resale in commerce , and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business ."
7079,Also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable .
7080,"As an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on `` pre-written '' ( not custom ) software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts , regardless of where it originates ."
7081,"However , the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service '' ."
7082,"In contrast , Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet ( such as downloaded software or music ) , except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services '' ."
7083,"Software ( pre-written or custom ) `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' ( i.e. , on disk ) in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online , except `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable `` programming services '' even if delivered on a disk ."
7084,"In most cases , this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location , remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions—up to every US state and locality that assesses them , if the company has a presence or `` nexus '' in every state ( as large `` brick-and-mortar '' sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do ) ."
7085,"In medicine , pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , and other symptoms , all of which are exacerbated by exertion ."
7086,Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
7087,It was first identified by Dr. Ernst von Romberg in 1891 .
7088,"According to the most recent classification , it can be one of five different types : arterial , venous , hypoxic , thromboembolic or miscellaneous ."
7089,"Sanuk , a division of Deckers Outdoor Corporation , is a footwear brand based in Southern California ."
7090,"Sanuk , the Thai word for fun , was founded by Southern California native Jeff Kelley when he started making sandals out of indoor-outdoor carpet ."
7091,The first product created was green carpeted and entitled the `` Fur Real '' after one shop owner asked if the novelty sandal was `` For Real . ''
7092,The Fur Real first became a runaway hit through boutique stores and not the intended surf shops .
7093,"The novelty act was followed up by a sandal wrapped in wire mesh , a leopard print version , and styles made out of a poncho material in a variety of colors ."
7094,"Sanuk has grown to include style options for men , women and youth and is distributed across the United States and in over 50 countries throughout Europe , Asia , South America and Australia ."
7095,"Sanuk centers itself around a positive lifestyle advocating the slogan , `` Smile , Pass it on ! `` ."
7096,"In computer science , array programming languages ( also known as vector or multidimensional languages ) generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors , matrices , and higher dimensional arrays ."
7097,Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation .
7098,The level of conciseness can be dramatic in certain cases : it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more than a couple of pages of Java code .
7099,"APL , designed by Ken Iverson , was the first programming language to provide array programming capabilities ."
7100,The mnemonic APL refers to the title of his seminal book `` A Programming Language '' and not to arrays per se . Iverson 's contribution to rigor and clarity was probably more important than the simple extension of dimensions to functions .
7101,"In the United States an annuity contract is created when an insured party , usually an individual , pays a life insurance company a single premium that will later be distributed back to the insured party over time ."
7102,"Annuity contracts traditionally provide a guaranteed distribution of income over time , such as via fixed payments , until the death of the person or persons named in the contract or until a final date , whichever comes first ."
7103,"However , the majority of modern annuity customers use annuities only to accumulate funds free of income and capital gains taxes and to later take lump-sum withdrawals without using the guaranteed-income-for-life feature ."

7116,"Agency debt also known as an Agency bond is a security , usually a bond , issued by a U.S. government-sponsored agency ."
7117,The offerings of these agencies are backed but not guaranteed by the US government since the agencies are private entities .
7118,"Some prominent issuers of these securities are Student Loan Marketing Association ( Sallie Mae ) , Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) ."
7119,"Agency securities are usually exempt from state and local taxes , but not federal tax ."

7126,Nuclear power is the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity .
7127,"Nuclear power plants provided about 5.7 % of the world 's energy and 13 % of the world 's electricity , in 2012 ."
7128,"In 2013 , the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear power reactors ( although not all are producing electricity ) , in 31 countries ."
7129,"In addition , there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation , powered by some 180 reactors ."
7130,There is an ongoing debate about the use of nuclear energy .
7131,"Proponents , such as the World Nuclear Association , the IAEA and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions ."
7132,"Opponents , such as Greenpeace International and NIRS , believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment ."
7133,"Nuclear power plant accidents include the Chernobyl disaster ( 1986 ) , Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ( 2011 ) , and the Three Mile Island accident ( 1979 ) ."
7134,There have also been some nuclear-powered submarine mishaps .
7135,"Research into safety improvements is continuing and nuclear fusion , believed to be safer , may be used in the future ."
7136,"As of 2012 , according to the IAEA , worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries ."
7137,"In the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60 years , and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration ."
7138,"However , Japan 's 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster prompted a rethink of nuclear energy policy in many countries ."
7139,"Germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022 , and Italy has banned nuclear power ."
7140,"Following Fukushima , the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 ."
7141,Photograph of the Berlin Wall taken from the West side .
7142,The Wall was built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing from Communism .
7143,It was an iconic symbol of the Cold War and its fall in 1989 marked the end of the War .
7144,"The Cold War , often dated from 1947 to 1991 , was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States with NATO among its allies , and powers in the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union along with the Warsaw Pact ."
7145,"This began after the success of their temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany , leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences ."
7146,"A neutral faction arose with the Non-Aligned Movement founded by Egypt , India , and Yugoslavia ; this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East ."
7147,The Cold War was so named because the two major powers—each possessing nuclear weapons and thereby threatened with mutual assured destruction —never met in direct military combat .
7148,"Instead , in their struggle for global influence they engaged in ongoing psychological warfare and in regular indirect confrontations through proxy wars ."
7149,"Cycles of relative calm would be followed by high tension , which could have led to world war ."
7150,"The tensest times were during the Berlin Blockade ( 1948–1949 ) , the Korean War ( 1950–1953 ) , the Suez Crisis ( 1956 ) , the Berlin Crisis of 1961 , the Cuban missile crisis ( 1962 ) , the Vietnam War ( 1959–1975 ) , the Yom Kippur War ( 1973 ) , the Soviet war in Afghanistan ( 1979–1989 ) , the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ( 1983 ) , and the `` Able Archer '' NATO military exercises ( 1983 ) ."
7151,"The conflict was expressed through military coalitions , strategic conventional force deployments , extensive aid to client states , espionage , massive propaganda campaigns , conventional and nuclear arms races , appeals to neutral nations , rivalry at sports events ( in particular the Olympics ) , and technological competitions such as the Space Race ."
7152,"The US and USSR became involved in political and military conflicts in the Third World countries of Latin America , Africa , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia ."
7153,"To alleviate the risk of a potential nuclear war , both sides sought relief of political tensions through détente in the 1970s ."
7154,"In the 1980s , the United States increased diplomatic , military , and economic pressures on the Soviet Union , at a time when the communist state was already suffering from economic stagnation ."
7155,"In the mid-1980s , the new Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika ( `` reorganization '' , 1987 ) and glasnost ( `` openness '' , ca . 1985 ) ."
7156,"Pressures for national independence grew stronger in Eastern Europe , especially Poland ."
7157,They reached a breaking point when Gorbachev refused to use Soviet troops to support the faltering government of East Germany in late 1989 .
7158,Within weeks all the satellite states broke free from Moscow in a peaceful wave of revolutions ( there was some violence in Romania ) .
7159,"The pressures escalated inside the Soviet Union , where Communism fell and the USSR was formally dissolved in late 1991 ."

7177,Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues .
7178,"Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests ."
7179,"Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who `` call in '' ( usually via telephone ) to the show ."
7180,"Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producer ( s ) in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , attract advertisers ."
7181,"Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments ."
7182,"Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk and sports talk ."
7183,"While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts ."
7184,"Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station ."

7372,Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest and most destructive Atlantic hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season .
7373,"It was the costliest natural disaster , as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes , in the history of the United States ."
7374,"Among recorded Atlantic hurricanes , it was the sixth strongest overall ."
7375,"At least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods , making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane ; total property damage was estimated at $ 81 billion ( 2005 USD ) , nearly triple the damage brought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 ."
7376,"Hurricane Katrina formed over the Bahamas on August 23 , 2005 and crossed southern Florida as a moderate Category 1 hurricane , causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico ."
7377,"The hurricane strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane over the warm Gulf water , but weakened before making its second landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on the morning of Monday , August 29 in southeast Louisiana ."
7378,"It caused severe destruction along the Gulf coast from central Florida to Texas , much of it due to the storm surge ."
7379,"The most significant number of deaths occurred in New Orleans , Louisiana , which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed , in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland ."
7380,"Eventually 80 % of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded , and the floodwaters lingered for weeks ."
7381,"However , the worst property damage occurred in coastal areas , such as all Mississippi beachfront towns , which were flooded over 90 % in hours , as boats and casino barges rammed buildings , pushing cars and houses inland , with waters reaching 6–12 miles ( 10–19 km ) from the beach ."
7382,"The hurricane surge protection failures in New Orleans are considered the worst civil engineering disaster in U.S. history and prompted a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) , the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the Flood Control Act of 1965 ."
7383,"Responsibility for the failures and flooding was laid squarely on the Army Corps in January 2008 by Judge Stanwood Duval , U.S. District Court , but the federal agency could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 ."
7384,"There was also an investigation of the responses from federal , state and local governments , resulting in the resignation of Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) director Michael D. Brown , and of New Orleans Police Department ( NOPD ) Superintendent Eddie Compass ."

7389,Red lines indicate the `` debt held by the public '' and black lines indicate the total national debt or gross public debt .
7390,"The difference is the `` intragovernmental debt , '' which includes obligations to government programs such as Social Security ."
7391,"Stated as a formula , National Debt = Debt held by the Public + Intragovernmental Debt ."
7392,The second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of U.S. GDP ( dollar value of U.S. economic production for that year ) .
7393,The top panel is deflated so every year is in 2010 dollars .
7394,The United States public debt is the money borrowed by the federal government of the United States through the issuing of securities by the Treasury and other federal government agencies .
7395,US public debt consists of two components:
7396,"Debt held by the public includes Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government , including that held by individuals , corporations , the Federal Reserve System and foreign , state and local governments ."
7397,"Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt includes non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries , such as the Social Security Trust Fund ."
7398,"Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses , including interest earnings , of these accounts that have been invested in Treasury securities ."
7399,Public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual unified budget deficit or surplus .
7400,"The federal government budget deficit or surplus is the difference between government receipts and spending , ignoring intra-governmental transfers ."
7401,"However , some spending that is excluded from the deficit ( supplemental appropriations ) also adds to the debt ."
7402,"Historically , the US public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions , and subsequently declined ."
7403,"For example , debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II ( 113 % of GDP in 1945 ) , but then fell over the following 30 years ."
7404,"In recent decades , however , large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government 's fiscal policies ."
7405,"On 2 April 2013 , debt held by the public was approximately $ 11.959 trillion or about 75 % of GDP ."
7406,"Intragovernmental holdings stood at $ 4.846 trillion , giving a combined total public debt of $ 16.805 trillion ."
7407,"As of January 2013 , $ 5.6 trillion or approximately 47 % of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors , the largest of which were the People 's Republic of China and Japan at just over $ 1.1 trillion each ."
7408,"In basketball , an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal , meaning that he or she was `` assisting '' in the basket ."
7409,There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist .
7410,An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball .
7411,"However , the original definition of an assist did not include such situations , so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter ."
7412,"Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist , so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal ( unlike in other sports , such as ice hockey ) ."
7413,"A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA , but does in FIBA play ( only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made ) ."
7414,"Point guards tend to get the most assists per game ( apg ) , as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler ."
7415,"Centers tend to get fewer assists , but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting ."
7416,"Being inside the key , the center often has the best angles and the best position for `` dishes '' and other short passes in the scoring area ."
7417,Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in assists in 1968 .
7418,"A strong center with inside-scoring prowess , such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon , can also be an effective assistor because the defense 's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters ."
7419,"The NBA single-game assist record is 30 , held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic against the Denver Nuggets , on December 30 , 1990 ."
7420,"The NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton with 15,806 ."
7421,"The mill or mille ( ) ( sometimes mil in the UK , when discussing property taxes in the United States , or previously in Cyprus and Malta ) is a now-abstract unit of currency used sometimes in accounting ."
7422,"In the United States , it is a notional unit equivalent to of a United States dollar ( a tenth of a cent ) ."
7423,In the United Kingdom it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the decimalization of the pound as a division of the pound sterling .
7424,"Several other currencies used the mill , such as the Maltese lira ."
7425,"The term comes from the Latin `` millesimum '' , meaning `` thousandth part '' ."
7426,The Greco-Persian Wars ( also often called the Persian Wars ) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and city-states of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC .
7427,The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC .
7428,"Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia , the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them ."
7429,This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike .
7430,"In 499 BC , the then tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos , with Persian support ; however , the expedition was a debacle and , pre-empting his dismissal , Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians ."
7431,"This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt , which would last until 493 BC , progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict ."
7432,"Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria , and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis ."
7433,The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act .
7434,"The revolt continued , with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC ."
7435,"In 494 BC , the Persians regrouped , and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus ."
7436,"At the Battle of Lade , the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat , and the rebellion collapsed , with the final members being stamped out the following year ."
7437,"Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks , Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for burning Sardis ."
7438,"The first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC , with the Persian general Mardonius conquering Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign ."
7439,"In 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece , this time across the Aegean Sea , under the command of Datis and Artaphernes ."
7440,"This expedition subjugated the Cyclades , before besieging , capturing and razing Eretria ."
7441,"However , while en route to attack Athens , the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon , ending Persian efforts for the time being ."
7442,"Darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of Greece , but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes I ."
7443,"In 480 BC , Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled ."
7444,Victory over the 'Allied ' Greek states ( led by Sparta and Athens ) at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun most of Greece .
7445,"However , while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet , the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis ."
7446,"The following year , the confederated Greeks went on the offensive , defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea , and ending the invasion of Greece ."
7447,"The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale , before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos ( 479 BC ) and Byzantium ( 478 BC ) ."
7448,"The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans , and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership , as the so-called Delian League ."
7449,"The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades , beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe ."
7450,"At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC , the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia ."
7451,"However , the League 's involvement in an Egyptian revolt ( from 460–454 BC ) resulted in a disastrous defeat , and further campaigning was suspended ."
7452,"A fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC , but achieved little , and when it withdrew the Greco-Persian Wars drew to a quiet end ."
7453,"Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia , the so-called Peace of Callias ."

7463,Hasselbeck then signed a contract with the Indianapolis Colts in 2013 less than 24 hours after being released by the Tennessee Titans .
7464,ICT is inevitably related to the computer network .
7465,"Information and Communications Technology or ( ICT ) , is often used as an extended synonym for information technology ( IT ) , but is a more specific term that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications ( telephone lines and wireless signals ) , computers as well as necessary enterprise software , middleware , storage , and audio-visual systems , which enable users to access , store , transmit , and manipulate information ."
7466,"The phrase ICT had been used by academic researchers since the 1980s , but it became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in 1997 and in the revised National Curriculum for England , Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000 ."
7467,The term ICT is now also used to refer to the convergence of audio-visual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system .
7468,"There are large economic incentives ( huge cost savings due to elimination of the telephone network ) to merge the audio-visual , building management and telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling , signal distribution and management ."
7469,The term Infocommunications is used in some cases as a shorter form of information and communication ( s ) technology .
7470,In fact Infocommunications is the expansion of telecommunications with information processing and content handling functions on a common digital technology base .

7473,"A schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom ; in Thomson 's mathematical model the `` corpuscles '' ( or modern electrons ) were arranged non-randomly , in rotating rings"
7474,The current model of the sub-atomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons
7475,"The plum pudding model of the atom by J. J. Thomson , who discovered the electron in 1897 , was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model ."
7476,"In this model , the atom is composed of electrons ( which Thomson still called `` corpuscles '' , though G. J. Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 ) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons ' negative charges , like negatively charged `` plums `` surrounded by positively charged `` pudding `` ."
7477,"The electrons ( as we know them today ) were thought to be positioned throughout the atom , but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons , particularly rotating rings of electrons ( see below ) ."
7478,"Instead of a soup , the atom was also sometimes said to have had a `` cloud '' of positive charge ."
7479,"With this model , Thomson abandoned his earlier `` nebular atom '' hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vortices ."
7480,"Now , at least part of the atom was to be composed of Thomson 's particulate negative corpuscles , although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined ."
7481,The 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden .
7482,This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911
7483,"to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge ( in the case of gold , enough to balance about 100 electrons ) , thus leading to the Rutherford model of the atom ."
7484,"Although gold has an atomic number of 79 , immediately after Rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den Broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear charge ."
7485,The matter required experiment to decide .
7486,"Henry Moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 ( see Moseley 's law ) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number ( Moseley found only one unit difference ) , and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and Rutherford ."
7487,"This work culminated in the solar-system-like ( but quantum-limited ) Bohr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells ."
7488,Bohr had also inspired Moseley 's work .
7489,"Thomson 's model was compared ( though not by Thomson ) to a British dessert called plum pudding , hence the name ."
7490,"Thomson 's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine , the leading British science journal of the day ."
7491,"In Thomson 's view : ... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , ..."
7492,"In this model , the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance ."
7493,"These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud , it felt a larger net positive inward force , because there was more material of opposite charge , inside its orbit ( see Gauss 's law ) ."
7494,"In Thomson 's model , electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons , and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits ."
7495,"Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements , but was not notably successful at this ."
7496,"Still , Thomson 's model ( along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell 's model of Saturn 's rings ) , were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like Bohr model of the atom ."
7497,Typical strip of bacon .
7498,Bacon is a cured meat prepared from a pig .
7499,"It is first cured using large quantities of salt , either in a brine or in a dry packing ; the result is fresh bacon ( also known as green bacon ) ."
7500,"Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air , or it may be boiled or smoked ."
7501,Fresh and dried bacon is typically cooked before eating .
7502,"Boiled bacon is ready to eat , as is some smoked bacon , but may be cooked further before eating ."
7503,Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat .
7504,"It is usually made from side and back cuts of pork , except in the United States , where it is almost always prepared from pork belly ( typically referred to as `` streaky '' , `` fatty '' , or `` American style '' outside of the US and Canada ) ."
7505,The side cut has more meat and less fat than the belly .
7506,"Bacon may be prepared from either of two distinct back cuts : fatback , which is almost pure fat , and pork loin , which is very lean ."
7507,Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon .
7508,Uncooked pork belly bacon strips .
7509,"Bacon may be eaten smoked , boiled , fried , baked , or grilled , or used as a minor ingredient to flavor dishes ."
7510,"Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts , especially game , e.g . venison , pheasant ."
7511,"The word is derived from the Old High German bacho , meaning `` buttock '' , `` ham '' or `` side of bacon '' , and cognate with the Old French bacon ."
7512,"In continental Europe , this part of the pig is usually not smoked like bacon is in the United States ; it is used primarily in cubes ( lardons ) as a cooking ingredient , valued both as a source of fat and for its flavor ."
7513,"In Italy , this is called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or served uncooked and thinly sliced as part of an antipasto ."
7514,"Meat from other animals , such as beef , lamb , chicken , goat , or turkey , may also be cut , cured , or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon , and may even be referred to as `` bacon '' ."
7515,Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations .
7516,"The USDA defines bacon as `` the cured belly of a swine carcass '' ; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified ( e.g. , `` smoked pork loin bacon '' ) ."
7517,"For safety , bacon must be treated to prevent trichinosis , caused by Trichinella , a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating , freezing , drying , or smoking ."
7518,Bacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine ( or dry packing ) .
7519,"Bacon brine has added curing ingredients , most notably sodium nitrite , and occasionally sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate ( saltpeter ) ; sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilize color ."
7520,Flavorings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products .
7521,"If used , sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan fried ."
7522,"Today , a brine for ham , but not bacon , includes a large amount of sugar ."
7523,"Historically , `` ham '' and `` bacon '' referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically , often together in the same barrel ."

7541,"In human anatomy , the ulnar nerve is a nerve which runs near the ulna bone ."
7542,The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve .
7543,"The nerve is the largest unprotected nerve in the human body ( meaning unprotected by muscle or bone ) , so injury is common ."
7544,"This nerve is directly connected to the little finger , and the adjacent half of the ring finger , supplying the palmar side of these fingers , including both front and back of the tips , perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds ."
7545,"One method of injuring the nerve is to strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly , or inferiorly with the elbow flexed ."
7546,The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point .
7547,This is commonly referred to as bumping one 's `` funny bone '' .
7548,"This name is thought to be a pun , based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm , the `` humerus `` and the word `` humorous `` ."

7554,The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008 .
7555,"It was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures , and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgages ."
7556,"Several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008 , with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession ."
7557,"There were many causes of the crisis , with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions , regulators , credit agencies , government housing policies , and consumers , among others ."
7558,A proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending .
7559,"The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8 % or lower range to approximately 20 % from 2004 to 2006 , with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S ."
7560,"A high percentage of these subprime mortgages , over 90 % in 2006 for example , were adjustable-rate mortgages ."
7561,These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products .
7562,"Further , U.S. households had become increasingly indebted , with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77 % in 1990 to 127 % at the end of 2007 , much of this increase mortgage-related ."
7563,"When U.S. home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid-2006 , borrowers ' ability to refinance their loans became more difficult ."
7564,"As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates ( causing higher monthly payments ) , mortgage delinquencies soared ."
7565,"Securities backed with mortgages , including subprime mortgages , widely held by financial firms globally , lost most of their value ."
7566,Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending .
7567,Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe .
7568,"The crisis had severe , long-lasting consequences for the U.S. and European economies ."
7569,"The U.S. entered a deep recession , with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 , roughly 6 % of the workforce ."
7570,U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30 % on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50 % by early 2009 .
7571,"As of early 2013 , the U.S. stock market had recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated ."
7572,Economic growth remained below pre-crisis levels .
7573,Europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis .
7574,Carl Jung in 1910 .
7575,Myers and Briggs extrapolated their MBTI theory from Jung 's writings in his book Psychological Types .
7576,The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions .
7577,"These preferences were extrapolated from the typological theories proposed by Carl Gustav Jung and first published in his 1921 book Psychological Types ( English edition , 1923 ) ."
7578,"Jung theorized that there are four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world : sensation , intuition , feeling , and thinking ."
7579,One of these four functions is dominant most of the time .
7580,"The original developers of the personality inventory were Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter , Isabel Briggs Myers ; these two , having studied extensively the work of Jung , turned their interest of human behavior into a devotion of turning the theory of psychological types to practical use ."
7581,"They began creating the indicator during World War II , believing that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would be `` most comfortable and effective '' ."
7582,"The initial questionnaire grew into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator , which was first published in 1962 ."
7583,The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences .
7584,"Robert Kaplan and Dennis Saccuzzo believe `` the underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences , and these preferences underlie our interests , needs , values , and motivation '' ( p. 499 ) ."

7587,"Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne , `` Judas '' is a dance and electro house song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her ."
7588,"It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past , and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she ca n't escape ."
7589,Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one 's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light .
7590,The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word .
7591,"In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups , the song was generally well received by critics , who likened the song to `` Bad Romance `` with some noting it should have been the album 's lead single ."
7592,"The song has a similar sound to Gaga 's previous RedOne-produced tracks , including `` Poker Face `` , `` LoveGame `` , `` Bad Romance '' , and `` Alejandro `` ."
7593,It contains three distinct hooks and a house -influenced break down .
7594,"Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption , regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be ."
7595,"`` Judas '' initially had a strong sales opening , but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga 's previous singles ."
7596,"The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets , and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea ."
7597,"A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011 , co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus ."
7598,It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene .
7599,The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem .
7600,"It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus , and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death ."
7601,"Before its release , the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the alleged use of religious imagery and her role in the video ."
7602,"However , critics generally praised the video , not finding any offensive content ."
7603,The video was nominated for two awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards .

7645,The number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of Congress to which the state is entitled .
7646,The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors .
7647,"There are 538 electors , based on there being 435 representatives and 100 senators , plus the three electors from the District of Columbia ."
7648,"Electors are pledged to particular presidential and vice presidential candidates , though unpledged electors are possible ."
7649,"In all states , except Maine and Nebraska , electors are elected on a `` winner-take-all '' basis ."
7650,"That is , all electors pledged to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes in a state become electors for that state ."
7651,"Maine and Nebraska use the `` congressional district method '' , selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote ."
7652,"Although no elector is required by federal law to honor a pledge , there have only been very few occasions when an elector voted contrary to a pledge ."
7653,The Twelfth Amendment specifies how a President and Vice President are elected and requires each elector to cast one vote for President and another vote for Vice President .
7654,Critics argue that the Electoral College is inherently undemocratic and gives swing states disproportionate influence in electing the President and Vice President .
7655,"The Electoral College gives a numeric advantage in the election of the president to the smaller states , as the minimum number of electors for the small states is three compared to one for the election of representatives ."
7656,"On the other hand , the winner-take-all method of voting favors the larger states ."
7657,A number of constitutional amendments have been proposed seeking to alter the Electoral College or replace it with a direct popular vote .

7728,"A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil ' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion , usually described as turbulence or drag ."
7729,"Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams , because in addition to directing air flow they also reduce the amount of air flowing underneath the vehicle which generally reduces aerodynamic lift and drag ."
7730,"Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars , although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well ."
7731,Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse .

7751,"On 28 June 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne , and his wife , Sophie , Duchess of Hohenberg , were shot dead in Sarajevo , by Gavrilo Princip , one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo Ilić ."
7752,The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary 's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia .
7753,The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia .
7754,Serbian military officers stood behind the attack .
7755,"At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić , and Masterspy Rade Malobabić ."
7756,Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them .
7757,The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary .
7758,"The assassins , the key members of the clandestine tunnel , and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested , tried , convicted and punished ."
7759,Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914 .
7760,The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges ; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators .
7761,Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records .
7762,Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later .
7763,"Mission San Juan Capistrano was a Spanish mission in Southern California , located in present-day San Juan Capistrano ."
7764,"It was founded on All Saints ' Day November 1 , 1776 , by Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order ."
7765,"Named for Giovanni da Capistrano , a 15th century theologian and `` warrior priest '' who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy , San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use , a chapel built in 1782 ."
7766,"Known alternately as `` Serra 's Chapel '' and `` Father Serra 's Church , '' it is the only extant structure where it has been documented that the padre Junipero Serra celebrated mass ."
7767,One of the best known of the Alta California missions ( and one of the few missions to have actually been founded twice—others being Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission La Purísima Concepción ) .
7768,"The site was originally consecrated on October 30 , 1775 , by Father Fermín Lasuén , but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego ."
7769,The success of the settlement is evident in its historical records .
7770,"Prior to the arrival of the missionaries , some 550 natives were scattered throughout the local area ."
7771,"By 1790 , the number of converted Christians had grown to 700 , and just six years later nearly 1,000 `` neophytes `` ( recent converts ) lived in or around the Mission compound ."
7772,"1,649 baptisms were conducted that year alone , out of the total 4,639 souls converted between 1776 and 1847 ."
7773,"More than 2,000 former inhabitants ( mostly Juaneño Indians ) are buried in unmarked graves in the Mission 's cemetery ( campo santo ) ."
7774,"The remains of Father ( later Monsignor ) St. John O'Sullivan , who recognized the property 's historic value and working tirelessly to conserve and rebuild its structures , are buried at the entrance to the cemetery on the west side of the property , and a statue raised in his honor stands at the head of the crypt ."
7775,"The surviving chapel also serves as the final resting place of three padres who passed on while serving at the Mission : Fathers José Barona , Vicente Fustér , and Vicente Pascual Oliva are all entombed beneath the sanctuary floor ."
7776,"The Criolla or `` Mission grape , '' was first planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779 ; in 1783 , the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from the Mission 's winery ."
7777,The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after secularization in 1833 .
7778,"Numerous efforts were made over the years to restore the Mission to its former glory , but none met with great success until the arrival of Father O'Sullivan in 1910 ."
7779,"Restoration efforts continue , and `` Serra 's Chapel '' is still used for religious services ."
7780,"About half-a-million visitors , including 80,000 school children , come to the Mission each year ."
7781,"And while the ruins of `` The Great Stone Church '' ( which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake ) are a renowned architectural wonder , the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual `` Return of the Swallows '' which is traditionally observed every March 19 ( Saint Joseph 's Day ) ."
7782,"Mission San Juan Capistrano has served as a favorite subject for many notable artists , and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times , perhaps more than any other mission ."
7783,"In 1984 , a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound and is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano ."
7784,"Today , the mission compound serves as a museum , with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish ."

7807,"Based among poor , white cotton farmers in the South ( especially North Carolina , Alabama , and Texas ) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the plains states ( especially Kansas and Nebraska ) , it represented a radical crusading form of agrarianism and hostility to banks , railroads , and elites generally ."
7808,"It sometimes formed coalitions with labor unions , and in 1896 the Democrats endorsed their presidential nominee , William Jennings Bryan ."
7809,The terms `` populist '' and `` populism `` are commonly used for anti-elitist appeals in opposition to established interests and mainstream parties .
7810,A series of events led to the attack on Pearl Harbor .
7811,"War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation 's military forces planned for since the 1920s , though real tension did not begin until the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by Japan ."
7812,"Over the next decade , Japan expanded slowly into China , leading to all out war between the two in 1937 ."
7813,"In 1940 Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to embargo all imports into China , including war supplies purchased from the U.S ."
7814,"This move prompted the United States to embargo all oil exports , leading the Imperial Japanese Navy to estimate that it had less than two years of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies ."
7815,Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the `` Southern Resource Area '' to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that Japan envisioned in the Pacific .
7816,"The Philippine islands , at that time an American territory , were also a Japanese target ."
7817,The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response .
7818,"Rather than seize and fortify the islands , and wait for the inevitable US counterattack , Japan 's military leaders instead decided on the pre-emptive Pearl Harbor attack , which they assumed would negate the American forces needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands ."
7819,"Planning for the attack had begun in very early 1941 , by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ."
7820,"He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by , among other things , threatening to resign ."
7821,The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall .
7822,"Simultaneously over the year , pilots were trained , and ships prepared for its execution ."
7823,Authority for the attack was granted at the second Imperial Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was not reached .
7824,After final approval by Emperor Hirohito the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December .
7825,A common office stapler
7826,A common school stapler
7827,A stapler is a mechanical device that joins sheets of paper or similar material by driving a thin metal staple through the sheets and folding the ends .
7828,"Staplers are widely used in government , business , offices , homes and schools ."
7829,The word `` stapler '' can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses .
7830,"In addition to joining paper sheets together , staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together with surgical staples to close a surgical wound ( much in the same way as stitches or sutures ) ."
7831,"Typically , most staplers are used to join multiple sheets of paper ."
7832,Paper staplers come in two distinct types : manual and electric .
7833,"Manual staplers are normally hand-held , although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon ."
7834,Electric staplers exist in a variety of different designs and models .
7835,Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession .
7836,Some electric staplers can join up to 20 sheets at a time .
7837,"Swallowing , known scientifically as deglutition , is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth , to the pharynx , and into the esophagus , while shutting the epiglottis ."
7838,"If this fails and the object goes through the trachea , then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur ."
7839,In the human body it is controlled by the swallowing reflex .
7840,"Thaddeus Stevens ( April 4 , 1792 – August 11 , 1868 ) , of Pennsylvania , was a leader of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party and a fierce opponent of slavery ."
7841,He was one of the most influential members in the history of Congress .
7842,"As chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee , Stevens , a witty , sarcastic speaker and flamboyant party leader , dominated the House from 1861 until his death ."
7843,He wrote much of the financial legislation that paid for the American Civil War .
7844,Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner were the prime leaders of the Radical Republicans during the war and Reconstruction era .
7845,Scholarly views of Stevens have swung sharply since his death as interpretations of Reconstruction have changed .
7846,"Historians of the Dunning School ( 1890s–1940s ) held Stevens responsible for demanding harsh treatment of the white South and violating American traditions of republicanism , depicting Stevens as a villain for his advocacy of harsh measures in the South such as disfranchising all ex-Confederates ."
7847,This highly negative characterization held sway into the 1950s .
7848,The rise of the neo-abolitionist school in the 1950s led to a strong positive appreciation of Stevens ' work on civil rights for Freedmen .
7849,"A recent biographer characterizes him as , `` The Great Commoner , savior of free public education in Pennsylvania , national Republican leader in the struggles against slavery in the United States and intrepid mainstay of the attempt to secure racial justice for the Freedmen during Reconstruction , the only member of the House of Representatives ever to have been known as the 'dictator ' of Congress .

7850,Overview of the translation of eukaryotic messenger RNA
7851,Diagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome
7852,"In molecular biology and genetics , translation is the process through which cellular ribosomes manufacture proteins ."
7853,It is part of the process of gene expression .
7854,"In translation , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain , or polypeptide , that will later fold into an active protein ."
7855,"In bacteria , translation occurs in the cell 's cytoplasm , where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located , and bind to the mRNA ."
7856,"In eukaryotes , translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis ."
7857,The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA .
7858,The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is `` read '' by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape .
7859,"In many instances , the entire ribosome/mRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and releases the nascent protein polypeptide inside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell ."
7860,"Many types of transcribed RNA , such as transfer RNA , ribosomal RNA , and small nuclear RNA , do not undergo translation into proteins ."
7861,"Translation proceeds in four phases : initiation , elongation , translocation and termination ( all describing the growth of the amino acid chain , or polypeptide that is the product of translation ) ."
7862,Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins .
7863,"In activation , the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA ( tRNA ) ."
7864,The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3 ' OH of the tRNA by an ester bond .
7865,"When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it , it is termed `` charged '' ."
7866,Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5 ' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors ( IF ) .
7867,"Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon ( UAA , UAG , or UGA ) ."
7868,No tRNA can recognize or bind to this codon .
7869,"Instead , the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex ."
7870,"A number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation ; these include anisomycin , cycloheximide , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , streptomycin , erythromycin , and puromycin , among others ."
7871,"Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes , and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host 's cells ."
7872,A multimedia message on a mobile phone .
7873,Multimedia Messaging Service ( MMS ) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from mobile phones .
7874,It extends the core SMS ( Short Message Service ) capability that allowed exchange of text messages only up to 160 characters in length .
7875,"The most popular use is to send photographs from camera-equipped handsets , although it is also popular as a method of delivering news and entertainment content including videos , pictures , text pages and ringtones ."
7876,"The standard is developed by the Open Mobile Alliance ( OMA ) , although during development it was part of the 3GPP and WAP groups ."
7877,"Smallpox was an infectious disease unique to humans , caused by either of two virus variants , Variola major and Variola minor ."
7878,"The disease is also known by the Latin names Variola or Variola vera , derived from varius ( `` spotted '' ) or varus ( `` pimple '' ) ."
7879,The disease was originally known in English as the `` pox '' or `` red plague '' ; the term `` smallpox '' was first used in Britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola from the `` great pox '' ( syphilis ) .
7880,The last naturally occurring case of smallpox ( Variola minor ) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977 .
7881,Smallpox localized in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat .
7882,"In the skin it resulted in a characteristic maculopapular rash and , later , raised fluid-filled blisters ."
7883,V. major produces a more serious disease and has an overall mortality rate of 30–35 % .
7884,"V. minor causes a milder form of disease ( also known as alastrim , cottonpox , milkpox , whitepox , and Cuban itch ) which kills about 1 % of its victims ."
7885,"Long-term complications of V. major infection include characteristic scars , commonly on the face , which occur in 65–85 % of survivors ."
7886,"Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring , and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis are less common complications , seen in about 2–5 % of cases ."
7887,"Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC ."
7888,The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt .
7889,"The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century ( including five reigning monarchs ) , and was responsible for a third of all blindness ."
7890,"Of all those infected , 20–60 % —and over 80 % of infected children—died from the disease ."
7891,Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million deaths during the 20th century .
7892,"As recently as 1967 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year ."
7893,"After vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in 1979 ."
7894,"Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated , the other being rinderpest , which was declared eradicated in 2011 ."
7895,`` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' is a song by the English rock band the Beatles .
7896,"Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , and recorded in October 1963 , it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment ."
7897,"With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom , `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release ( 29 November 1963 ) had it not been blocked by the group 's first million seller `` She Loves You `` , the Beatles ' previous UK single , which was having a resurgent spell in the top position following intense media coverage of the group ."
7898,"Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor , `` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total ."
7899,"It was also the group 's first American number one , entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry ."
7900,"By 1 February it held the number one spot — for seven weeks — before being replaced by `` She Loves You '' , a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain , and remained in the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks ."
7901,`` I Want to Hold Your Hand '' became the Beatles ' best-selling single worldwide .
7902,A gasser was a type of hot rod originating on the dragstrips of the United States in the late 1950s and continued until the early 1970s .
7903,"Gassers were based on production models from the 1930s to mid-1960s , which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a truck beam axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration ( Beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension ) , though a raised stock front suspension is common as well ."
7904,"Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels , stripped interiors and plexiglass windows ( sometimes color tinted ) ."
7905,"Because they were primarily built for racing , these cars typically had the engine swapped to a larger or more powerful one , the existing stock engine modified ( often heavily ) or both ."
7906,"It was very common to fit a Roots supercharger and mechanical fuel injection , such as one from Algon , Hilborn , or Crower ."
7907,"With form being dictated by function , their appearance is often very top heavy and ungainly , largely due to front ends being raised higher than stock , to assist in the weight transfer during rapid acceleration ( racing ) ."
7908,"Having their exhaust pipes exit through the front fender well is a common characteristic of gassers , as is having bodies painted in flamboyant metalflakes , pearls , and candy finishes complemented by lettering in wild fonts ."
7909,"The name arose because they competed in a gasoline -fueled drag racing class , rather than one using methanol or nitromethane ."
7910,The gasser is the predecessor of the modern Funny Car .
7911,Twelve-lead EKG of a 26-year-old male
7912,"Electrocardiography ( ECG or EKG from ) is a transthoracic ( across the thorax or chest ) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time , as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body ."
7913,The recording produced by this noninvasive procedure is termed an electrocardiogram ( also ECG or EKG ) .
7914,"An ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats , as well as the size and position of the chambers , the presence of any damage to the heart , and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart , such as a pacemaker ."
7915,"Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts , but may also be performed on animals , usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research ."
7916,"Donald John Trump , Sr. ( born June 14 , 1946 ) is an American business magnate , television personality and author ."
7917,He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts .
7918,"Trump 's extravagant lifestyle , outspoken manner , and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No . 14 on the 2012 Forbes Celebrity 100 list ."
7919,"Trump is the son of Fred Trump , a wealthy New York City real-estate developer ."
7920,"He worked for his father 's firm , Elizabeth Trump & Son , while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , and in 1968 officially joined the company ."
7921,He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization .
7922,"In 2010 , Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for president of the United States in the 2012 election , though in May 2011 , he announced he would not be a candidate ."
7923,"In December 2011 , Trump was suggested as a possible vice presidential selection by Michele Bachmann , if she were to win the Republican nomination ."
7924,"`` A Change Is Gon na Come '' is a 1964 single by R & B singer-songwriter Sam Cooke , written and first recorded in 1963 and released under the RCA Victor label shortly after his death in late 1964 ."
7925,"Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles , the song came to exemplify the 1960s ' Civil Rights Movement ."
7926,"The song has gained in popularity and critical acclaim in the decades since its release , and is # 12 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time ."
7927,Steam rising from the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland .
7928,Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth .
7929,Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter .
7930,The Geothermal energy of the Earth 's crust originates from the original formation of the planet ( 20 % ) and from radioactive decay of minerals ( 80 % ) .
7931,"The geothermal gradient , which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface , drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface ."
7932,"The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη ( ge ) , meaning earth , and θερμος ( thermos ) , meaning hot ."
7933,"At the core of the Earth , thermal energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 °C ( 9,000 °F ) ."
7934,Heat conducts from the core to surrounding cooler rock .
7935,"The high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt , creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock ."
7936,"The magma heats rock and water in the crust , sometimes up to 370 °C ( 700 °F ) ."
7937,"From hot springs , geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times , but it is now better known for electricity generation ."
7938,"Worldwide , about 10,715 megawatts ( MW ) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries ."
7939,"An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating , space heating , spas , industrial processes , desalination and agricultural applications ."
7940,"Geothermal power is cost effective , reliable , sustainable , and environmentally friendly , but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries ."
7941,"Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources , especially for applications such as home heating , opening a potential for widespread exploitation ."
7942,"Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth , but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels ."
7943,"As a result , geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels ."
7944,"The Earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity 's energy needs , but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited ."
7945,Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive .
7946,"Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology , energy prices , subsidies , and interest rates ."
7947,Pilot programs like EWEB 's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal .
7948,"But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience , the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the past two decades ."
7949,"In 2001 , geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh ."
7950,"Ownership of property may be private , collective , or common and the property may be objects , land/real estate , or intellectual property ."
7951,Determining ownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the property .
7952,"These rights and duties , sometimes called a 'bundle of rights ' , can be separated and held by different parties ."
7953,"The question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers , Plato and Aristotle , who held different opinions on the subject ."
7954,"Plato ( 428/427 BC – 348/347 BC ) thought private property created divisive inequalities , while Aristotle ( 384 BC – 322 BC ) thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor ."
7955,"Private property can circumvent what is now referred to as the “ tragedy of the commons ” problem , where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private property ."
7956,"Given a short-sighted owner , however , a private property system can make these tragedies worse—for example , a private owner of a piece of oil-rich property , depending on his worldview , might be more interested in short-term financial gain than incremental use with an eye toward other 's concerns ( e.g. , those of future generations , the disenfranchised , etc . ) ."
7957,"While Aristotle justified the existence of private ownership , he left open questions of ( 1 ) how to allocate property between what is private and common and ( 2 ) how to allocate the private property within society ."
7958,"Over the millennia , and across cultures what can be property and how it is regarded culturally have varied widely ."
7959,"Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money , trade , debt , bankruptcy , the criminality of theft , and private vs. public property ."
7960,Ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic system .
7961,Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a person 's property and possessions .
7962,"The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex : one can gain , transfer and lose ownership of property in a number of ways ."
7963,"To acquire property one can purchase it with money , trade it for other property , receive it as a gift , steal it , find it , make , it or homestead it ."
7964,"One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money , exchanging it for other property , giving it as a gift , being robbed of it , it , or having it stripped from one 's ownership through legal means such as eviction , foreclosure , seizure , or taking ."
7965,Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property .
7966,"`` What 's My Name ? '' is a song recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna , for her fifth studio album Loud ( 2010 ) ."
7967,"Featuring guest vocals from Canadian rapper Drake , the song was released as the second single from Loud on October 29 , 2010 through Def Jam Recordings ."
7968,"The R & B song was produced by the Norwegian production duo StarGate , and was written by the duo along with Ester Dean , Traci Hale , and Drake ."
7969,"Lyrically , it incorporates themes of sexual intercourse and romance ."
7970,"Music critics gave the song positive reviews , citing it some of Rihanna 's best vocal work to date ; there was a praise regarding its romantic nature , as well as its sexual tones ."
7971,"`` What 's My Name ? '' was a commercial success and topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , giving Rihanna her third number-one single in 2010 , as well as her eighth overall on the chart ."
7972,"The song also topped the charts in Hungary and the United Kingdom and reached the top five in Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , Norway and Slovakia ."
7973,The song received a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration .
7974,"An accompanying music video , directed by Philip Andelman , portrays a romantic encounter between Rihanna and Drake in a grocery store along with romantic scenes between the pair and Rihanna walking through Manhattan 's Lower East Side ."
7975,"`` What 's My Name ? '' was promoted with live performances across both sides of the Atlantic , including Saturday Night Live in America and the series seven finale of The X Factor in the United Kingdom ."
7976,"The latter performance resulted in an investigation from the country 's media regulator , Ofcom , for the raunchy nature of Rihanna 's outfit ."
7977,"A mathematical constant is a special number , usually a real number , that is `` significantly interesting in some way '' ."
7978,"Constants arise in many different areas of mathematics , with constants such as e ( mathematical constant ) | and pi| occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry , number theory and calculus ."
7979,"What it means for a constant to arise `` naturally '' , and what makes a constant `` interesting '' , is ultimately a matter of taste , and some mathematical constants are notable more for historical reasons than for their intrinsic mathematical interest ."
7980,The more popular constants have been studied throughout the ages and computed to many decimal places .
7981,All mathematical constants are definable numbers and usually are also computable numbers ( Chaitin 's constant being a significant exception ) .
7982,"Elections to the United States Senate were held on November 2 , 2010 , for 37 of the United States Senate 's 100 seats ."
7983,"( A special election on January 19 , 2010 in Massachusetts was held earlier in the year . )"
7984,"Thirty-four of the seats were for six-year terms to the Senate 's `` class three '' , and three were special elections for shorter terms ."
7985,"Of the 37 elections , 19 featured incumbent Democrats ( 7 of whom retired or were defeated in the primary ) and 18 featured incumbent Republicans ( eight of whom retired or were defeated in the primary ) ."
7986,"After the previous elections ( in 2008 ) , the United States Senate was composed of 58 Democrats , 40 Republicans , and 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats ."
7987,Republicans won four seats held by retiring Democrats and Republicans defeated two incumbent Democrats .
7988,This was the largest number of Republicans gains since the 1994 elections and also the first time since that election that Republicans successfully defended all of their own seats .
7989,This was the fourth consecutive election of `` class 3 '' senators where Democrats have failed to gain seats and the third consecutive mid-term election held in a president 's first term where Republicans have picked-up seats .
7990,"Despite these Republican wins , however , the Democrats retained a majority of the Senate with 51 seats plus 2 independents who caucus with them , compared to the 47 Republicans ."
7991,A solstice is an astronomical event that occurs twice each year as the Sun reaches its highest or lowest excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere .
7992,"As a result , on the day of the solstice , the Sun appears to have reached its highest or lowest annual altitude in the sky above the horizon at local solar noon ."
7993,"The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol ( sun ) and sistere ( to stand still ) , because at the solstices , the Sun stands still in declination ; that is , the seasonal movement of the Sun 's path ( as seen from Earth ) comes to a stop before reversing direction ."
7994,"The solstices , together with the equinoxes , are connected with the seasons ."
7995,In many cultures the solstices mark either the beginning or the midpoint of winter and summer .
7996,"The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense , as the date ( day ) when this occurs ."
7997,The day of the solstice is either the longest day of the year ( in summer ) or the shortest day of the year ( in winter ) for any place outside of the tropics .
7998,"Jerry Lee Lewis ( born September 29 , 1935 ) is an American rock and roll and country music singer-songwriter and pianist ."
7999,He is known by the nickname `` The Killer '' and is often viewed as “rock & roll 's first great wild man” .
8000,"An early pioneer of rock and roll music , in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records ."
8001,"`` Crazy Arms `` sold 300,000 copies in the South , but it was his 1957 hit `` Whole Lotta Shakin ' Going On `` that shot Lewis to fame worldwide ."
8002,"Lewis followed this in that same year when he recorded songs such as `` Great Balls of Fire `` , `` Breathless `` and `` High School Confidential `` ."
8003,Lewis sold more records than Elvis Presley at this time .
8004,"However , Lewis ' rock 'n ' roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his young cousin ."
8005,He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded .
8006,"His live performance fees plummeted from $ 10,000 per night to $ 250 ."
8007,In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity .
8008,During the early 60’s he did n't have much chart success with few exceptions such as `` What 'd I Say `` .
8009,His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic .
8010,"His album Live at the Star Club , Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever ."
8011,"After recording songs such as `` I 'm on Fire '' for several years with little success , in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as `` Another Place , Another Time '' ."
8012,This reignited his career and throughout the late '60s and '70s he regularly topped the country-western charts .
8013,"His # 1 country hits included `` To Make Love Sweeter For You `` , `` There Must Be More to Love Than This `` , `` Would You Take Another Chance on Me `` and `` Me And Bobby McGee `` ."
8014,Lewis 's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock 'n ' roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper 's `` Chantilly Lace `` and `` Rockin ' My Life Away `` .
8015,In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour to audiences around the world and still releases new albums .

8025,"The Emancipation Proclamation was an order issued to all segments of the Executive branch ( including the Army and Navy ) of the United States by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1 , 1863 , during the American Civil War ."
8026,It was based on the president 's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces ; it was not a law passed by Congress .
8027,"It proclaimed all those enslaved in Confederate territory to be forever free , and ordered the Army ( and all segments of the Executive branch ) to treat as free all those enslaved in ten states that were still in rebellion , thus applying to 3.1 million of the 4 million slaves in the U.S ."
8028,"The Proclamation could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion , but as the army took control of Confederate regions , the slaves in those regions were emancipated rather than returned to their masters ."
8029,"From 20,000 to 50,000 former slaves in regions where rebellion had already been subdued were immediately emancipated , and over 3 million more were emancipated as the Union army advanced ."
8030,"The Proclamation did not apply to the five slave states that were not in rebellion , nor to most regions already controlled by the Union army ; emancipation there would come after separate state actions and/or the December 1865 ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment , which made slavery illegal everywhere in the U.S ."
8031,"The Proclamation did not compensate the owners , did not itself outlaw slavery , and did not make the ex-slaves ( called freedmen ) citizens ."
8032,"It made the eradication of slavery an explicit war goal , in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union ."
8033,"On September 22 , 1862 , Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state of the Confederate States of America that did not return to Union control by January 1 , 1863 ."
8034,"None returned , and the order , signed and issued January 1 , 1863 , took effect except in locations where the Union had already mostly regained control ."
8035,"The Proclamation outraged white Southerners who envisioned a race war , angered some Northern Democrats , energized anti-slavery forces , and weakened forces in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy ."
8036,"It also lifted the spirits of African Americans both in the Southern and Northern States , and led to many slaves escaping their masters and running behind Union lines in order to have their emancipation enforced ."

8046,"Most cameras sold today are digital , and digital cameras are incorporated into many devices ranging from PDAs and mobile phones ( called camera phones ) to vehicles ."
8047,"Digital and film cameras share an optical system , typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device ."
8048,"The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager , just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical ."
8049,"However , unlike film cameras , digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded , and store and delete images from memory ."
8050,Many digital cameras can also record moving video with sound .
8051,Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing .

8115,"The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants , but its side effects are much less pronounced ."
8116,Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects .
8117,Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine ( Prozac ) for some subtypes of depression .
8118,Treatment of panic disorder with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life .
8119,"For obsessive-compulsive disorder , sertraline is not as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments ."
8120,"Although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder , sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions ."
8121,Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment .
8122,"Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs , with high rates of nausea , diarrhea , insomnia , and sexual side effects ; however , it does not cause weight gain , and its effects on both cognition and vigilance are relatively mild ."
8123,"In pregnant women taking sertraline , the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood , and was also associated with a higher rate of various birth defects ."

8132,The movie received mixed reviews from critics .
8133,"A typical 12 V , 40 Ah Lead-acid car battery"
8134,An automotive battery is a type of rechargeable battery that supplies electric energy to an automobile .
8135,"Usually this refers to an SLI battery ( starting , lighting , ignition ) to power the starter motor , the lights , and the ignition system of a vehicle’s engine ."
8136,"Automotive SLI batteries are usually lead-acid type , and are made of six galvanic cells in series to provide a 12 volt system ."
8137,Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volt at full charge .
8138,"Heavy vehicles such as highway trucks or tractors , often equipped with diesel engines , may have two batteries in series for a 24 volt system , or may have parallel strings of batteries ."
8139,"Lead-acid batteries are made up of plates of lead and separate plates of lead dioxide , which are submerged into an electrolyte solution of about 38 % sulfuric acid and 62 % water ."
8140,"This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons , allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity ."
8141,"As the battery discharges , the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates , changing their surface to lead sulfate ."
8142,"When the battery is recharged , the chemical reaction is reversed : the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide and lead ."
8143,"With the plates restored to their original condition , the process may now be repeated ."
8144,"Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for manufacture of new batteries , diverts toxic lead from landfills , and prevents risk of improper disposal ."
8145,Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer .
8146,"Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time , temporary , or flexible workers , such as annual leave , sickleave , and health insurance ."
8147,Full-time jobs are often considered careers .
8148,"They generally pay more than part-time jobs , and usually carry more hours per week ."
8149,The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment .
8150,This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer ( US Department of Labor ) .
8151,The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's Employee Handbook .
8152,Companies commonly require from 30–35 or 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits .
8153,Full-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week .
8154,"The `` standard '' work week consists of five eight-hour days , commonly served between 9:00AM to 5:00PM totaling 40 hours ."
8155,While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days ; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36 hour work week .
8156,"Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week , unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime ."
8157,Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week .
8158,The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half .
8159,The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts .
8160,"Shifts can also be very irregular , as in retail , but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached ."
8161,"There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time , which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker ."
8162,The Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 .

8164,The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs .
8165,"The legislation created five Schedules ( classifications ) , with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each ."
8166,"Two federal agencies , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration , determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules , though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing , and Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000 , which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate in Schedule I . Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse ( an undefined term ) , currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , and international treaties ."

8174,"After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960 , Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election ."
8175,"Johnson succeeded to the presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , completed Kennedy 's term and was elected President in his own right , winning by a large margin over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election ."
8176,"Johnson was greatly supported by the Democratic Party and as President , he was responsible for designing the `` Great Society `` legislation that included laws that upheld civil rights , public broadcasting , Medicare , Medicaid , environmental protection , aid to education , and his `` War on Poverty . ''"
8177,"Johnson was renowned for his domineering personality and the `` Johnson treatment , '' his coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation ."
8178,"Meanwhile , Johnson escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War , from 16,000 American advisors/soldiers in 1963 to 550,000 combat troops in early 1968 , as American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down ."
8179,The involvement stimulated a large angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses in the U.S. and abroad .
8180,"Summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965 , and crime rates soared , as his opponents raised demands for `` law and order '' policies ."
8181,"The Democratic Party split in multiple feuding factions , and after Johnson did poorly in the 1968 New Hampshire primary , he ended his bid for reelection ."
8182,Republican Richard Nixon was elected to succeed him .
8183,Historians argue that Johnson 's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States after the New Deal era .
8184,Johnson is ranked favorably by some historians because of his domestic policies .

8251,"The brothers ' fundamental breakthrough was their invention of three-axis control , which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium ."
8252,This method became standard and remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds .
8253,"From the beginning of their aeronautical work , the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving `` the flying problem '' ."
8254,This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines .
8255,"Using a small homebuilt wind tunnel , the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before , enabling them to design and build wings and propellers that were more efficient than any before ."
8256,"Their first U.S. patent , 821,393 , did not claim invention of a flying machine , but rather , the invention of a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine 's surfaces ."
8257,"They gained the mechanical skills essential for their success by working for years in their shop with printing presses , bicycles , motors , and other machinery ."
8258,Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle like a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice .

8296,A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed in 1642 .
8297,"A modern reconstruction of the Globe , named `` Shakespeare 's Globe `` , opened in 1997 approximately from the site of the original theatre ."
8298,"It 's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra , based on the short story `` The Greatest Gift `` , which Philip Van Doren Stern wrote in 1939 and privately published in 1945 ."
8299,"The film is considered one of the most loved films in American cinema and has become traditional viewing during the Christmas season , alongside popular classics such as Charles Dickens ' A Christmas Carol ."
8300,"The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey , a man who has given up his dreams in order to help others and whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel , Clarence Odbody ( Henry Travers ) ."
8301,Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be had he never been born .
8302,"Despite initially performing poorly at the box office due to high production costs and stiff competition at the time of its release , the film has come to be regarded as a classic and is a staple of Christmas television around the world ."
8303,"Theatrically , the film 's break-even point was actually $ 6.3 million , approximately twice the production cost , a figure it never came close to achieving in its initial release ."
8304,"An appraisal in 2006 reported : `` Although it was not the complete box office failure that today everyone believes ... it was initially a major disappointment and confirmed , at least to the studios , that Capra was no longer capable of turning out the populist features that made his films the must-see , money-making events they once were . ''"
8305,"The film was nominated for five Oscars and has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made , placing number 11 on its initial 1998 greatest movie list , and would also place number one on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time ."
8306,Data Warehouse Overview
8307,"In computing , a data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse ( DW , DWH , or EDW ) is a database used for reporting and data analysis ."
8308,It is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sources .
8309,Data warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting such as annual and quarterly comparisons .
8310,"The data stored in the warehouse are uploaded from the operational systems ( such as marketing , sales etc. , shown in the figure to the right ) ."
8311,The data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before they are used in the DW for reporting .
8312,"The typical ETL -based data warehouse uses staging , data integration , and access layers to house its key functions ."
8313,The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems .
8314,The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store ( ODS ) database .
8315,"The integrated data are then moved to yet another database , often called the data warehouse database , where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate facts ."
8316,The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema .
8317,The access layer helps users retrieve data .
8318,"A data warehouse constructed from an integrated data source systems does not require ETL , staging databases , or operational data store databases ."
8319,The integrated data source systems may be considered to be a part of a distributed operational data store layer .
8320,Data federation methods or data virtualization methods may be used to access the distributed integrated source data systems to consolidate and aggregate data directly into the data warehouse database tables .
8321,"Unlike the ETL-based data warehouse , the integrated source data systems and the data warehouse are all integrated since there is no transformation of dimensional or reference data ."
8322,This integrated data warehouse architecture supports the drill down from the aggregate data of the data warehouse to the transactional data of the integrated source data systems .
8323,Data warehouses can be subdivided into data marts .
8324,Data marts store subsets of data from a warehouse .
8325,This definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage .
8326,"The main source of the data is cleaned , transformed , cataloged and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining , online analytical processing , market research and decision support ( Marakas & O'Brien 2009 ) ."
8327,"However , the means to retrieve and analyze data , to extract , transform and load data , and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system ."
8328,Many references to data warehousing use this broader context .
8329,"Thus , an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools , tools to extract , transform and load data into the repository , and tools to manage and retrieve metadata ."
8330,"Portland stone quarry on the Isle of Portland , England"
8331,"An abandoned construction aggregate quarry near Adelaide , South Australia"
8332,A quarry is a type of open-pit mine from which rock or minerals are extracted .
8333,"Quarries are generally used for extracting building materials , such as dimension stone , construction aggregate , riprap , sand , and gravel ."
8334,They are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement for large amounts of aggregate in those materials .
8335,Open mines that produce minerals are typically referred to as open pit mines .
8336,"The word quarry can include underground quarrying for stone , such as Bath stone ."
8337,"Mormons ( ) are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism , the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity , which began with the visions of Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s ."
8338,After Smith 's death in 1844 the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory .
8339,Today Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) .
8340,Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing .
8341,"The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah , and North America has more Mormons than any other continent , though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States ."
8342,Mormons have developed a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history .
8343,"During the 19th century Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location , and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage , a form of religious polygamy ."
8344,"Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church , and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission ."
8345,"Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages , tobacco , coffee , tea , and other addictive substances ."
8346,"They tend to be very family-oriented , and have strong connections across generations and with extended family , reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death and throughout eternity ."
8347,"Mormons also have a strict law of chastity , requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of marriage and strict fidelity within marriage ."
8348,"Mormons self-identify as Christian , though some of their beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity ."
8349,"Mormons believe in the Bible , as well as other books of scripture , such as the Book of Mormon ."
8350,"They have a unique view of cosmology , and believe that all people are spirit-children of God ."
8351,"Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ , and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism ."
8352,"They believe that Christ 's church was restored through Joseph Smith , and is guided by living prophets and apostles ."
8353,Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers .
8354,"In financial accounting , assets are economic resources ."
8355,Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value and that is held to have positive economic value is considered an asset .
8356,"Simply stated , assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash ( although cash itself is also considered an asset ) ."
8357,The balance sheet of a firm records the monetaryJ .
8358,"G. Siegel , N. Dauber & J. K. Shim , `` The Vest Pocket CPA '' , Wiley , 2005.There are different methods of assessing the monetary value of the assets recorded on the Balance Sheet ."
8359,"In some cases , the Historical Cost is used ; such that the value of the asset when it was bought in the past is used as the monetary value ."
8360,"In other instances , the present fair market value of the asset is used to determine the value shown on the balance sheet ."
8361,value of the assets owned by the firm .
8362,It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business .
8363,Two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets .
8364,"Tangible assets contain various subclasses , including current assets and fixed assets.J ."
8365,"Downes , J.E . Goodman , `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '' , Baron 's Financial Guides , 2003 Current assets include inventory , while fixed assets include such items as buildings and equipment .J . Downes , J.E . Goodman , `` Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms '' , Baron 's Financial Guides , 2003 ; and J. G. Siegel , N. Dauber & J. K. Shim , `` The Vest Pocket CPA '' , Wiley , 2005 ."
8366,Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place .
8367,"Examples of intangible assets are goodwill , copyrights , trademarks , patents and computer programs , and financial assets , including such items as accounts receivable , bonds and stocks ."
8368,A neuron ( or ; also known as a neurone or nerve cell ) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals .
8369,"A chemical signal occurs via a synapse , a specialized connection with other cells ."
8370,Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks .
8371,"Neurons are the core components of the nervous system , which includes the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral ganglia ."
8372,"A number of specialized types of neurons exist : sensory neurons respond to touch , sound , light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain ."
8373,"Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord , cause muscle contractions , and affect glands ."
8374,Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord .
8375,"A typical neuron possesses a cell body ( often called the soma ) , dendrites , and an axon ."
8376,"Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body , often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times , giving rise to a complex `` dendritic tree '' ."
8377,"An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance , as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species ."
8378,"The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites , but never to more than one axon , although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates ."
8379,"At the majority of synapses , signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another ."
8380,"There are , however , many exceptions to these rules : neurons that lack dendrites , neurons that have no axon , synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite , etc ."
8381,"All neurons are electrically excitable , maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps , which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium , potassium , chloride , and calcium ."
8382,Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels .
8383,"If the voltage changes by a large enough amount , an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated , which travels rapidly along the cell 's axon , and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives ."
8384,Neurons do not undergo cell division .
8385,"In most cases , neurons are generated by special types of stem cells ."
8386,"Astrocytes , a type of glial cell , have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency ."
8387,"In humans , neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas , the hippocampus and olfactory bulb , there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons ."
8388,Super Bowl XLIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Arizona Cardinals to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 2008 season .
8389,The Steelers defeated the Cardinals by the score of 27–23 .
8390,"The game was played on February 1 , 2009 , at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa , Florida ."
8391,"With this win , the Steelers became the first team to win six Super Bowls ."
8392,"Pittsburgh , who finished the regular season with a 12–4 record , also won their second Super Bowl in four years after winning Super Bowl XL at the end of the 2005 season ."
8393,"The Cardinals entered the game seeking their first NFL title since 1947 , the longest championship drought in the league ."
8394,"The club became an unexpected winner during the regular season , compiling a 9–7 record , and the playoffs with the aid of head coach Ken Whisenhunt , who was the Steelers ' offensive coordinator in Super Bowl XL , and the re-emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner , who was the Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXIV with his former team , St. Louis Rams ."
8395,"Pittsburgh jumped to a 17–7 halftime lead , aided by linebacker James Harrison 's Super Bowl record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown ."
8396,"Trailing 20–7 at the start of the fourth quarter , Arizona scored 16 unanswered points , including wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald 's 64-yard touchdown reception , to take the lead with 2:37 remaining in the game ."
8397,But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes ' 6-yard game-winning touchdown catch with 35 seconds left .
8398,"Holmes , who caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown , including four receptions for 73 yards on that final game-winning drive , was named Super Bowl MVP ."
8399,"He became the sixth wide receiver to win the award , and also was the third Pittsburgh receiver to win the award , following Lynn Swann and Hines Ward ."
8400,"Despite the global financial crisis and limited amount of ancillary festivities that are normally held before the game , the NBC television network broadcast attracted an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers , making it the most watched Super Bowl in history to that point ."
8401,"Marchantia , a liverwort"
8402,Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes ( land plants ) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called ' non-vascular plants ' .
8403,"Some bryophytes do have specialized tissues for the transport of water ; however since these do not contain lignin , they are not considered to be true vascular tissue ."
8404,"Currently bryophytes are thought not to be a natural or monophyletic group ; however the name is convenient and remains in use as a collective term for mosses , hornworts , and liverworts ."
8405,"Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures ( gametangia and sporangia ) , but they produce neither flowers nor seeds , reproducing via spores ."
8406,"The term bryophyte comes from Greek βρύον , bryon , `` tree-moss , oyster-green '' + φυτόν - phyton `` plant '' ."
8407,"A bank is a financial institution and a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and channels those deposits into lending activities , either directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets ."
8408,A bank is the connection between customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses .
8409,"Due to their influence within a financial system and an economy , banks are generally highly regulated in most countries ."
8410,Most banks operate under a system known as fractional reserve banking where they hold only a small reserve of the funds deposited and lend out the rest for profit .
8411,"They are generally subject to minimum capital requirements which are based on an international set of capital standards , known as the Basel Accords ."
8412,"The oldest bank still in existence is Monte dei Paschi di Siena , headquartered in Siena , Italy , which has been operating continuously since 1472 ."
8413,It is followed by Berenberg Bank of Hamburg ( 1590 ) and Sveriges Riksbank of Sweden ( 1668 ) .
8414,"Banking in its modern sense evolved in rich cities of Renaissance Italy , such as Florence , Venice and Genoa ."
8415,"In the history of banking , a number of banking dynasties —among them notably Medici , Fugger , Welser , Berenberg , Baring and Rothschild —have played a central role over many centuries ."
8416,The Xbox is a video game console manufactured by Microsoft .
8417,"It was released on November 15 , 2001 in North America , February 22 , 2002 in Japan , and March 14 , 2002 in Australia and Europe ."
8418,It was Microsoft 's first foray into the gaming console market .
8419,"As part of the sixth-generation of gaming , the Xbox competed with Sony 's PlayStation 2 , Sega 's Dreamcast ( which stopped American sales before the Xbox went on sale ) , and Nintendo 's GameCube ."
8420,The Xbox was the first console offered by an American company after the Atari Jaguar stopped sales in 1996 .
8421,The integrated Xbox Live service launched in November 2002 allowed players to play games online with a broadband connection .
8422,It first competed with Dreamcast 's online service but later primarily competed with PlayStation 2 's online service .
8423,"Although these two are free while Xbox Live required a subscription , as well as broadband-only connection which was not completely adopted yet , Xbox Live was a success due to better servers , features such as a buddy list , and milestone titles like Halo 2 released in November 2004 , which is the best-selling Xbox video game and was by far the most popular online game for years ."
8424,"Xbox 's successor , the Xbox 360 , was launched in November 2005 ."
8425,The Xbox was discontinued in late 2005 in Japan where sales were poor .
8426,It was discontinued in late 2006 in Europe and early 2007 in North America .
8427,"The last Xbox game in Europe was Tony Hawk 's Project 8 released in November 2006 , and the last game in North America was Madden NFL 09 released in August 2008 ."
8428,"Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2 , 2009 , stating that any in-warranty repair now needed will not be undertaken ."
8429,"Xbox access to Xbox Live was stopped on April 15 , 2010 ."
8430,"The Gospel According to John ( Greek τὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην εὐαγγέλιον ) , commonly referred to as the Gospel of John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the Fourth Gospel , is an account of the public ministry of Jesus ."
8431,"It begins with the witness and affirmation by John the Baptist and concludes with the death , burial , resurrection , and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus ."
8432,"This account is fourth of the canonical gospels , after the synoptics Matthew , Mark and Luke ."
8433,states that the book derives from the testimony of the ' disciple whom Jesus loved . '
8434,"Along with Peter , the unnamed disciple is especially close to Jesus , and early-church tradition identified him as John the Apostle , one of Jesus ' Twelve Apostles ."
8435,"The gospel is closely related in style and content to the three surviving Epistles of John such that commentators treat the four books together , yet , according to most modern scholars , John was not the author of any of these books ."
8436,Recent Christian Scripture scholarship more and more has placed John within a first-century Jewish context .
8437,Raymond E. Brown did pioneering work to trace the development of the tradition from which the gospel arose .
8438,The discourses seem to be concerned with the actual issues of the church-and-synagogue debate at the time when the Gospel was written .
8439,"It is notable that , in the gospel , the community still appears to define itself primarily against Judaism , rather than as part of a wider Christian church ."
8440,"Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism , gradually Christians and Jews became bitterly opposed ."
8441,"John presents a `` higher '' Christology than the synoptics , meaning that it describes Jesus as the incarnation of the divine Logos through whom all things were made , as the object of veneration , and more explicitly as God incarnate ."
8442,"Only in John does Jesus talk at length about himself and his divine role , often shared with the disciples only ."
8443,"Against the synoptics , John focuses largely on different miracles ( including resurrecting Lazarus ) , given as signs meant to engender faith ."
8444,Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John .
8445,It presents a realized eschatology in which salvation is already present for the believer .
8446,"The Plagues of Egypt ( ) , also called the Ten Plagues ( ) or the Biblical Plagues , were ten calamities that , according to the biblical Book of Exodus , Israel 's God , Yahweh , inflicted upon Egypt to persuade Pharaoh to release the ill-treated Israelites from slavery ."
8447,"Pharaoh capitulated after the tenth plague , triggering the Exodus of the Jewish people ."
8448,The plagues were designed to contrast the power of Yahweh with the impotence of Egypt 's various gods .
8449,"Some commentators have associated several of the plagues with judgment on specific gods associated with the Nile , fertility and natural phenomena ."
8450,"The plagues of Egypt are also mentioned in the Quran ( 7,133–136 ) ."
8451,"According to the Book of Exodus , God proclaims that all the gods of Egypt will be judged through the tenth and final plague:"

8453,A role-playing game ( RPG and sometimes roleplaying game ) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting .
8454,"Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development ."
8455,Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines .
8456,There are several forms of RPG .
8457,"The original form , sometimes called the tabletop RPG , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing games ( LARP ) players physically perform their characters ' actions ."
8458,"In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( GM ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used and acts as referee , while each of the other players plays the role of a single character ."
8459,"Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multi-player text-based MUDs and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs ) ."
8460,"Role-playing games also include single-player offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests , and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics ."
8461,"These games often share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling ."
8462,"Despite this variety of forms , some game forms such as trading card games and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included ."
8463,"Role-playing activity may sometimes be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus ."
8464,"The term is also sometimes used to describe roleplay simulation games and exercises used in teaching , training , and academic research ."
8465,"The definition of the world 's busiest airport has been specified by the Airports Council International in Geneva , Switzerland ."
8466,The ACI defines and measures the following three types of airport traffic:

8472,The total discharge is estimated at .
8473,"A massive response ensued to protect beaches , wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships , floating booms , controlled burns and of Corexit oil dispersant ."
8474,"After several failed efforts to contain the flow , the well was declared sealed on 19 September 2010 ."
8475,Some reports indicate the well site continues to leak .
8476,"Due to the months-long spill , along with adverse effects from the response and cleanup activities , extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats , fishing and tourism industries , and human health problems have continued through 2013.Three years after the spill , tar balls could still be found on the Mississippi coast ."
8477,Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill .
8478,"Notably , the U.S. government 's September 2011 report pointed to defective cement on the well , faulting mostly BP , but also well operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton ."
8479,"Earlier in 2011 , a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost-cutting decisions and an insufficient safety system , but also concluded that the spill resulted from `` systemic '' root causes and `` absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur '' ."
8480,"In November 2012 , BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter , two misdemeanors , and a felony count of lying to Congress ."
8481,"BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics , and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government ."
8482,BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $ 4.525 billion in fines and other payments but further legal proceedings not expected to conclude until 2014 are ongoing to determine payouts and fines under the Clean Water Act and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment .

8485,It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987 .
8486,"The song 's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end ."
8487,"Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast ."
8488,"During the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch ."
8489,"`` Where the Streets Have No Name '' was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the US , number fourteen in Canada , number ten in the Netherlands , and number four in the United Kingdom ."
8490,The song has become one of the band 's most popular songs and has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour .
8491,"The song was notably performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video , which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video .Recently the song has been used by the NFL 's Baltimore Ravens as their entrance song in Super Bowl XLVII"

8503,"Halley 's Comet or Comet Halley ( or ) , officially designated 1P/Halley , is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years ."
8504,"Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth , and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime ."
8505,"Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular , but will appear only once in thousands of years ."

8725,"By the middle of the Devonian Period , most of the features recognised in plants today are present , including roots , leaves and secondary wood ; and , by late Devonian times , seeds had evolved ."
8726,Late Devonian plants had thereby reached a degree of sophistication that allowed them to form forests of tall trees .
8727,Evolutionary innovation continued into the Carboniferous period and is still ongoing today .
8728,"Most plant groups were relatively unscathed by the Permo-Triassic extinction event , although the structures of communities changed ."
8729,"This may have set the scene for the appearance of the flowering plants in the Triassic ( ~ ) , and their later diversification in the Cretaceous and Paleogene ."
8730,"The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses , which became important in the mid-Paleogene , from around ."
8731,"The grasses , as well as many other groups , evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to survive the low and warm , dry conditions of the tropics over the last ."
8732,The winning Super Bowl team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy .
8733,The Super Bowl is an annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League ( NFL ) .
8734,"The contest is held in an American city that is chosen three to four years beforehand , usually in warm-weather or domed sites ."
8735,"Since 1971 , the winner of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs ."
8736,"Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests ."
8737,The first two were known as the `` AFL-NFL World Championship Game . ''
8738,"Super Bowl III in 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker , the names `` Super Bowl I `` and `` Super Bowl II `` were retroactively applied to the first two games ."
8739,"The NFC /NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 25 , while the AFC /AFL has won 22 ."
8740,"Eighteen different franchises , including teams that relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl ."
8741,"The Pittsburgh Steelers have won the most Super Bowls with six championships ( record 6–2 ) , while both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have five wins each ( Cowboys 5–3 ; 49ers 5–1 ) ."
8742,"Dallas and Pittsburgh have the most Super Bowl appearances with eight , while the Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993 ."
8743,"The New England Patriots , Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings have also lost a record four Super Bowls ."
8744,"Buffalo and Minnesota are both 0–4 , Denver is 2–4 and New England is 3–4 ."
8745,"The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the 1966-67 Green Bay Packers , the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins , the 1974-75 and 1978-79 Pittsburgh Steelers ( the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the 1988-89 San Francisco 49ers , the 1992-93 Dallas Cowboys , the 1997-98 Denver Broncos , and the 2003-04 New England Patriots ."
8746,"The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII unseated and replaced the 49ers in that position ."
8747,"Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns and Lions had won NFL Championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl ."
8748,Martin County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas .

8756,It is sometimes used synonymously as basic phosphatase .
8757,"Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , ( ) is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century ."
8758,The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden .
8759,"Commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first cross ) triticales ."
8760,"As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye ."
8761,Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop .
8762,"Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents ."
8763,"It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals ."
8764,"When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) ."
8765,"The resulting hybrid is sterile , and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself ."
8766,"The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia ."
8767,"In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world ."
8768,"The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species ."
8769,"In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid ."
8770,"In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale ."
8771,Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time .
8772,"The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application ."
8773,The CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries .
8774,"Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals ."
8775,"The protein content is higher than that of wheat , although the glutenin fraction is less ."
8776,The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat .
8777,"Assuming increased acceptance , the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale , as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale ."
8778,"Sell et al . found triticale could be used as a feed grain , and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested ."
8779,"As a feed grain , triticale is already well established and of high economic importance ."
8780,"It has received attention as a potential energy crop , and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop 's biomass in bioethanol production ."
8781,"`` Puff , the Magic Dragon '' is a song written by Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow , and made popular by Yarrow 's group Peter , Paul and Mary in a 1963 recording ."

8783,"A college football national championship in the highest level of collegiate play in the United States , currently the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , is a designation awarded annually by various third-party organizations to their selection ( s ) of the best college football team ( s ) ."
8784,Division I FBS ( formerly Division I-A ) football is the only NCAA sport in which a yearly champion is not determined by an NCAA sanctioned championship event .
8785,"Because the championship team is not determined by a NCAA championship or tournament event , it is sometimes unofficially referred to as a `` mythical national championship `` ."
8786,"Since the NCAA , the sport 's governing body , does not determine or declare a national champion in this field , determination of such has often engendered controversy ."
8787,"A championship team is independently declared by various individuals and organizations , often referred to as `` selectors '' ."
8788,These choices are sometimes at odds with each other .
8789,"While the NCAA has never officially endorsed an annual championship team , it has documented the choices of several selectors in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records ."
8790,"In addition , various third party analysts have independently published their own lists of what they have determined to be the most legitimate selections for each season ."
8791,"These are also often at odds with each other as well as individual school 's claims on national championships , which , for any particular season , may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere ."
8792,"Currently , two widely recognized national champions selectors are the Associated Press , which conducts a poll of football sportswriters , and the USA Today Coaches ' Poll , a poll of American Football Coaches Association active coaches that is contractually obligated to name the winner of the Bowl Championship Series championship game as its national champion ."
8793,"The Milwaukee Brewers are a professional baseball team based in Milwaukee , Wisconsin ."
8794,The team is a member of the Central Division of Major League Baseball 's National League and plays its home games at Miller Park .
8795,The team is so named because of the city 's association with the brewing industry .
8796,"The Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team based in Washington , D.C ."
8797,The Nationals are a member of the East Division of the National League of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
8798,"The team 's home ballpark is Nationals Park , located on South Capitol Street in Southeast D.C. , near the Anacostia River ."
8799,"The park opened in 2008 , replacing RFK Stadium , the team 's home from 2005 to 2007 ."
8800,The Nationals ' name derives from the former Washington baseball team that had the same name ( used interchangeably with Senators ) .
8801,Their nickname is `` the Nats '' —a shortened version that was also used by the old D.C. teams .
8802,"An expansion franchise , the club was founded in as the Montreal Expos , the first major league team in Canada ."
8803,"They were based in Montreal , Quebec , and played their home games at Jarry Park Stadium and later in Olympic Stadium ."
8804,"In , the Expos won a division championship , won their first-ever playoff series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies , 3–2 , and advanced to the National League Championship Series , where they would go on to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers , 3–2 , in their only postseason appearance during the strike-shortened season ."
8805,"The Expos had their highest winning percentage in the strike-shortened season of , when the team had the best record in baseball ."
8806,The team 's subsequent shedding of players caused fan interest to drop off .
8807,"After the 2001 season , MLB considered revoking the team 's franchise , along with either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays ."
8808,"After being purchased by MLB in 2002 , the team was moved before the season to Washington and renamed the Nationals , the first relocation since the second Washington Senators moved to Arlington , Texas , and became the Texas Rangers in ."
8809,"The Nationals are one of two MLB franchises , and the only one in the National League , that has never played in a World Series ( the Seattle Mariners are the other ) ."
8810,A contingent fee ( in the United States ) or conditional fee ( in England and Wales ) is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result .
8811,"In the law , it is defined as a `` fee charged for a lawyer 's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court ... ."
8812,Contingent fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the client 's net recovery . ''
8813,"In the English legal system , it is generally referred to as no win no fee ."
8814,A conditional fee agreement between a law firm and a client .
8815,"The usual form of this agreement is that the solicitor will take a law case on the understanding that if lost , no payment is made ."
8816,"However , if the case is won , the lawyer will be entitled to the normal fee based on hourly billing , plus a success fee ."
8817,The success fee in England must be as a percentage no greater than 100 % of the normal fee .
8818,"This contrasts with the contingency fee in the US , which gives the successful attorney a percentage of the damages awarded in favor of his client ."
8819,"This makes it easier for the poor to pursue their civil rights since otherwise , to sue someone for a tort , one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place ."
8820,"However , because of the high risk , few attorneys will take cases on a contingency basis unless they feel the case has good merit ."
8821,"According to a 2004 book by law professor Herbert Kritzer , contingent fees were allowed as of that year in the following countries : Australia , Brazil , Canada , the Dominican Republic , France , Greece , Ireland , Japan , New Zealand , the United Kingdom and the United States ."
8822,They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania .
8823,"Recently , they have been allowed in Belgium as well ."
8824,"A Convocation ( Latin 'calling together ' , translating the Greek ecclesia ) is a group of people formally assembled for a special purpose ."
8825,"Sons of Anarchy is a television drama series created by Kurt Sutter about the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in Charming , a fictional town in California 's Central Valley ."
8826,"The show centers on protagonist Jackson `` Jax '' Teller ( Charlie Hunnam ) , the then-vice president of the club , who begins questioning the club and himself ."
8827,"Sons of Anarchy premiered on September 3 , 2008 , on cable network FX ."
8828,"The third season of the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week , making it FX 's highest rated series ever , surpassing FX 's other hits The Shield , Nip/Tuck , and Rescue Me ."
8829,"On February 3 , 2012 , Sons of Anarchy was renewed for two additional seasons , a fifth and a sixth ."
8830,Those involved in the production of the series imply that a seventh and final season is creator Kurt Sutter 's plan .
8831,"The Grímsvötn sub-glacial lakes ( ; vötn = `` waters '' , singular : ) and the volcano of the same name are in South-East Iceland ."
8832,They are in the highlands of Iceland at the northwestern side of the Vatnajökull ice-cap .
8833,"The lakes are at , at an elevation of ."
8834,Beneath the lakes is the magma chamber of the Grímsvötn volcano .
8835,Grímsvötn is a basaltic volcano which has the highest eruption frequency of all the volcanoes in Iceland and has a southwest-northeast-trending fissure system .
8836,The massive climate-impacting Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784 was a part of the same fissure system .
8837,"Grímsvötn was erupting at the same time as Laki during 1783 , but continued to erupt until 1785 ."
8838,"Because most of the volcano lies underneath Vatnajökull , most of its eruptions have been subglacial and the interaction of magma and meltwater from the ice causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity ."
8839,"On 21 May 2011 at 19:25 UTC , an eruption began , with high plumes accompanied by multiple earthquakes , resulting in cancellation of 900 flights in Iceland , and in the United Kingdom , Greenland , Germany , Ireland and Norway on 22–25 May ."
8840,Until 25 May the eruption scale had been larger than that of the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull .
8841,"The eruption stopped at 02:40 UTC on 25 May 2011 , although there was some explosive activity from the tephra vents affecting only the area around the crater ."
8842,"Vetting is the process of performing a background check on someone before offering them employment , conferring an award , etc ."
8843,A prospective person or project may be vetted before making a hiring decision .
8844,"In addition , in intelligence gathering , assets are vetted to determine their usefulness ."
8845,Former headquarters and current corporate offices
8846,"Caesars Entertainment Corporation ( formerly Harrah 's Entertainment from 1995 to 2010 ) is an American public gaming corporation that owns and operates over 50 casinos , hotels , and seven golf courses under several brands ."
8847,"The company , based in Paradise , Nevada , is the largest gaming company in the world , with annual revenues of $ 8.9 billion ( 2010 ) ."
8848,"Caesars is a public company , with a joint venture of Apollo Global Management and Texas Pacific Group ownig a large portion of the stack and Blackstone Group also holding a significant stake ."

8852,A Permanent Resident in Canada is a person who is not a Canadian citizen but who has been granted permission to live and work in Canada without any time limit on his or her stay .
8853,A permanent resident must live in Canada for two years out of every five or risk losing that status .
8854,"A Permanent Resident holds many of the same rights and responsibilities as a Canadian citizen , among others the right to work for any enterprise as well as for the federal or provincial government ( under restriction of access rights to certain regulated professions ) ."
8855,The main differences are that residents can not :
8856,vote in elections in Canada ;
8857,run for elected office ;
8858,hold Canadian passports ;
8859,"In addition , they may be allowed to join Canada 's armed forces if the national interest would not be prejudiced ."
8860,Permanent residents also risk deportation for serious crimes committed while resident in Canada .
8861,Permanent residents may apply for Canadian citizenship after three years in Canada ; however this is not mandatory .
8862,Erica Kane is a fictional character from the American ABC Daytime soap opera All My Children .
8863,"The character was portrayed by actress Susan Lucci from her debut on January 16 , 1970 until the last broadcast television episode aired on September 23 , 2011 ."
8864,"On February 11 , 2013 , it was announced that Lucci will guest-star on the Prospect Park 's continuation of All My Children ."
8865,"In the U.S. , Erica is considered to be the most popular character in soap opera history ."
8866,"Regarding the North-American market , TV Guide calls her `` unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV '' , and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time ."
8867,"A graph of the US CPI from 1913 to 2006 ( in blue ) , and its percent annual change ( in red )"
8868,A consumer price index ( CPI ) measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households .
8869,The CPI in the United States is defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as `` a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services . ''
8870,The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically .
8871,"Sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services , being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index ."
8872,It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies .
8873,The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation .
8874,"A CPI can be used to index ( i.e. , adjust for the effect of inflation ) the real value of wages , salaries , pensions , for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values ."
8875,"In most countries , the CPI is , along with the population census and the USA National Income and Product Accounts , one of the most closely watched national economic statistics ."
8876,"Knocking on wood , or to touch wood , refers to the apotropaic tradition in western folklore of literally touching/knocking on wood , or merely stating that you are doing or intend same , in order to avoid `` tempting fate `` after making a favourable observation , a boast , or declaration concerning one 's own death ."
8877,Rocker arm
8878,"Generally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive , marine , motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines , the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it ."
8879,One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft ( either directly or via a tappet ( lifter ) and pushrod ) while the other end acts on the valve stem .
8880,"When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm , the inside presses down on the valve stem , opening the valve ."
8881,"When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation , the inside rises , allowing the valve spring to close the valve ."
8882,The drive cam is driven by the camshaft .
8883,This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft .
8884,Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller cam follower .
8885,A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker arm .
8886,"This rotates about the rocker shaft , and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve ."
8887,In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head .
8888,"The effective leverage of the arm ( and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem ) is determined by the rocker arm ratio , the ratio of the distance from the rocker arm 's center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod ."
8889,Current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1 .
8890,"However , in the past smaller positive ratios ( the valve lift is greater than the cam lift ) and even negative ratios ( valve lift smaller than the cam lift ) have been used ."
8891,Many pre-WW2 engines use 1:1 ( neutral ) ratios .
8892,"For car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings , providing a reasonable balance of strength , weight and economical cost ."
8893,"Because the rocker arms are , in part , reciprocating weight , excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engine 's ability to reach high operating speeds ."
8894,`` The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia '' is a Southern Gothic song written by songwriter Bobby Russell and performed in 1972 by his then-wife Vicki Lawrence .
8895,Reba McEntire later covered it in 1991 .
8896,"Recorded in late October 1972 in United/Western Studios on Sunset in Hollywood and released less than two weeks later in November 1972 , the song centers around the older brother of the narrator , falsely convicted of and executed for a murder , which the narrator herself has committed ."
8897,"In postal mail , a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message ."
8898,It provides the recipient ( and sometimes authorized intermediaries ) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed .
8899,"The return address need not include a sender 's name , but should include address or P.O . box details in the same way as the delivery address should ."
8900,"In some countries , the return address is conventionally located in the upper left hand corner of the envelope , card , or label ."
8901,"In the United Kingdom , the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope , near the top ."
8902,Businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address .
8903,Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence .
8904,Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots .
8905,Rolls of Return Address Labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes .
8906,The return address is not required on postal mail .
8907,"However , lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable ; such as from damage , postage due , or invalid destination ."
8908,Such mail may thus become dead letter mail .
8909,"Should the return address be of a different state or country , the mail may be routed through that location for ease of return ."
8910,"A nerve guidance conduit ( also referred to as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft , as opposed to an autograft ) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries ."
8911,"When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve can not be accomplished without tension , the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting ."
8912,"Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting , neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment , especially for large defects ."
8913,Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment .
8914,The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials .
8915,"Whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube , synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit , it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap , block external inhibitory factors , and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth ."
8916,"The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical , chemical , and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation ."
8917,"Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles , while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively ."
8918,"Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements : scaffold structure , scaffold material , cellular therapies , neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials ."
8919,"The choice of which physical , chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment , which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration ."
8920,"The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility , biodegradability , mechanical integrity , controllability during nerve growth , implantation and sterilization ."
8921,"Hardcore Pawn is an American reality television series produced by RDF USA ( later Zodiak USA ) and Richard Dominick Productions for truTV about the day-to-day operations of American Jewelry and Loan , a family-owned pawn shop located at 20450 Greenfield Road , between 8 Mile Road and the John C. Lodge Freeway in Detroit , Michigan ."
8922,"The series premiered on August 16 , 2010 , delivering two million viewers , setting a record as truTV 's most-watched series premiere ever ."
8923,Amoxicillin BP
8924,"Amoxicillin ( INN ) , formerly amoxycillin ( BAN ) , and abbreviated amox , is a moderate-spectrum , bacteriolytic , β-lactam antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms ."
8925,"It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed , following oral administration , than other β-lactam antibiotics ."
8926,Amoxicillin is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for children .
8927,The drug became available in 1972 .
8928,"Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase -producing bacteria , which are resistant to a broad spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics , such as penicillin ."
8929,"For this reason , it is often combined with clavulanic acid , a β-lactamase inhibitor ."
8930,This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to β-lactamase resistance .
8931,"The Big Bang Theory cast at Comic Con 2009 , from left : Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg , Kaley Cuoco , Jim Parsons , and Johnny Galecki"
8932,"The American sitcom The Big Bang Theory , created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady , premiered on CBS on September 24 , 2007 ."
8933,"The show centers on five characters : roommates Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter , two Caltech physicists ; Penny , a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall ; and Leonard and Sheldon 's friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz , and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali ."
8934,"Over time , several supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles : Leslie Winkle ( season 1 recurring ; season 2 regular ; season 3 guest ) , a physicist colleague , and , at different times , a lover of both Leonard and Howard ; Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz ( season 3 recurring ; season 4-present regular ) , a microbiologist , Howard 's fiancée and subsequent wife , and former part-time waitress alongside Penny ; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler ( season 3 guest ; season 4 recurring ; season 4-present regular ) , who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website ; and comic book store-owner , Stuart Bloom ( seasons 2–5 recurring ; season 6-present regular ) , who replaces Howard as Raj 's best friend when Howard is in space ."
8935,"The show also features numerous supporting characters , each of whom plays a prominent role in a small group of episodes ."
8936,Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans .
8937,"While it began with the last common ancestor of all life , the topic usually covers only the evolutionary history of primates , in particular the genus Homo , and the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of hominids ( or `` great apes '' ) ."
8938,"The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines , including physical anthropology , primatology , archaeology , linguistics , evolutionary psychology , embryology and genetics ."
8939,"According to genetic studies , primates diverged from other mammals about in the Late Cretaceous period , and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene , around ."
8940,"The family Hominidae diverged from the Hylobatidae ( Gibbon ) family 15-20 million years ago , and around , the Ponginae ( orangutans ) , diverged from the Hominidae family ."
8941,"Bipedalism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line , and the earliest bipedal Hominin is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin , with Ardipithecus , a full bipedal , coming somewhat later ."
8942,"The gorilla and chimpanzee diverged around the same time , about 4-6 million years ago , and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor with them ."
8943,The early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus Homo .
8944,The earliest documented members of the genus Homo are Homo habilis which evolved around ; the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone tools .
8945,The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee .
8946,"During the next million years a process of encephalization began , and with the arrival of Homo erectus in the fossil record , cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3 ."
8947,"Homo erectus and Homo ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave Africa , and these species spread through Africa , Asia , and Europe between ."
8948,It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools .
8949,"According to the Recent African Ancestry theory , modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from Homo heidelbergensis , Homo rhodesiensis or Homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago , replacing local populations of Homo erectus , Homo denisova , Homo floresiensis and Homo neanderthalensis ."
8950,"Archaic Homo sapiens , the forerunner of anatomically modern humans , evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago ."
8951,"Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-African populations , and Neanderthals and other hominids , such as Denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6 % of their genome to present-day humans. < ref name= '' 10.1126/science.1209202 '' > Anatomically modern humans evolved from archaic Homo sapiens in the Middle Paleolithic , about 200,000 years ago ."

9030,"Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain , he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general European awareness of the American continents ."
9031,"Those voyages , and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola , initiated the Spanish colonization of the New World ."
9032,"In the context of emerging western imperialism and economic competition between European kingdoms seeking wealth through the establishment of trade routes and colonies , Columbus 's speculative proposal , to reach the East Indies by sailing westward , eventually received the support of the Spanish crown , which saw in it a promise , however remote , of gaining the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative spice trade with Asia ."
9033,"During his first voyage in 1492 , instead of reaching Japan as he had intended , Columbus landed in the Bahamas archipelago , at a locale he named San Salvador ."
9034,"Over the course of three more voyages , Columbus visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles , as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America , claiming them for the Spanish Empire ."
9035,"Though Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas ( having been preceded by the Norse expedition led by Leif Ericson in the 11th century ) , Columbus 's voyages led to the first lasting European contact with the Americas , inaugurating a period of European exploration , conquest , and colonization that lasted for several centuries ."
9036,"They had , therefore , an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern Western world ."
9037,Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the Christian religion .
9038,"Never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans , rather than the East Indies he had set out for , Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited indios ( Spanish for `` Indians `` ) ."
9039,"Columbus 's strained relationship with the Spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and dismissal as governor of the settlements on the island of Hispaniola in 1500 , and later to protracted litigation over the benefits which Columbus and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown ."

9046,Serial ATA ( SATA ) is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical drives .
9047,"Serial ATA replaces the older AT Attachment standard ( ATA ; later referred to as Parallel ATA or PATA ) , offering several advantages over the older interface : reduced cable size and cost ( seven conductors instead of 40 ) , native hot swapping , faster data transfer through higher signalling rates , and more efficient transfer through an ( optional ) I/O queuing protocol ."
9048,SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors .
9049,"In contrast , parallel ATA ( the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications ) used a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals , all operating at much lower frequency ."
9050,"To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications , SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command-set as legacy ATA devices ."
9051,"SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers , and has largely replaced PATA in new embedded applications ."
9052,SATA 's market share in the desktop PC market was 99 % in 2008 .
9053,"PATA remains widely used in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash storage , even though the new CFast standard is based on SATA ."
9054,Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from The Serial ATA International Organization ( aka .
9055,"SATA-IO , serialata.org ) ."
9056,"The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates , reviews , ratifies , and publishes the interoperability specifications , the test cases , and plug-fests ."

9130,"The term `` RAID '' was first defined by David Patterson , Garth A. Gibson , and Randy Katz at the University of California , Berkeley in 1987 ."
9131,Marketers representing industry RAID manufacturers later attempted to reinvent the term to describe a redundant array of independent disks as a means of disassociating a low-cost expectation from RAID technology .
9132,RAID is now used as an umbrella term for computer data storage schemes that can divide and replicate data among multiple physical drives : RAID is an example of storage virtualization and the array can be accessed by the operating system as one single drive .
9133,"The different schemes or architectures are named by the word RAID followed by a number ( e.g . RAID 0 , RAID 1 ) ."
9134,"Each scheme provides a different balance between the key goals : reliability and availability , performance and capacity ."

9161,Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta or the thinner farina .
9162,`` Instant grits '' have been processed to speed cooking .
9163,"The word `` grits '' derives from the Old English word `` grytt , '' meaning coarse meal ."
9164,This word originally referred to wheat and other porridges now known as groats in parts of the U.K..
9165,"Maize , unknown in Europe in the Middle Ages , is a food derived from corn ( a New World plant ) and `` corn '' had been used to describe wheat products in many European regions ."
9166,"`` Grits '' may be either singular or plural ; historically , in the American South the word was invariably singular notwithstanding its plural form ( cf . such food names as `` spaghetti '' or `` linguine '' , likewise plural in form , but singular in use ) ."
9167,"Sometimes , grits are called sofkee or sofkey ( from a native American Muskogee word ) ."
9168,"In molecular biology , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception ."
9169,"Later during pregnancy it is made by the developing placenta , and later by the placental component syncytiotrophoblast ."
9170,"Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone ; therefore , elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis ."
9171,"However , it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis ."
9172,"The pituitary analogue of hCG , known as luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages ."
9173,", the FDA has prohibited the sale of `` homeopathic '' and over the counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal ."
9174,"An ombudsman is an official , usually appointed by the government or by parliament but with a significant degree of independence , who is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints of maladministration or violation of rights ."
9175,"In some countries an Inspector General , Citizen Advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman , and may also be appointed by the legislature ."
9176,"Below the national level an ombudsman may be appointed by a state , local or municipal government , and unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by , or even work for , a corporation such as a utility supplier or a newspaper , for an NGO , or for a professional regulatory body ."
9177,"Whether appointed by the legislature , the executive , or an organization ( or , less frequently , elected by the constituency that he or she serves ) , the typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them , usually through recommendations ( binding or not ) or mediation ."
9178,Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people 's rights .
9179,"At the national level , most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector , and sometimes also elements of the private sector ( for example , contracted service providers ) ."
9180,"In some cases , there is a more restricted mandate , for example with particular sectors of society ."
9181,More recent developments have included the creation of specialised Children 's Ombudsman and Information Commissioner agencies .
9182,"In some jurisdictions an ombudsman charged with the handling of concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the `` Parliamentary Commissioner '' ( e.g . the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration , and the Western Australian state Ombudsman ) ."
9183,"In many countries where the ombudsman 's remit extends beyond dealing with alleged maladministration to promoting and protecting human rights , the ombudsman is recognised as the national human rights institution ."
9184,The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union .
9185,Making a complaint to an ombudsman is usually free of charge .

9219,Standard form of the periodic table .
9220,The colors represent different categories of elements explained below .
9221,"The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements , organized on the basis of their atomic numbers , electron configurations , and recurring chemical properties ."
9222,Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number ( number of protons ) .
9223,"The standard form of table comprises an 18 × 7 grid or main body of elements , positioned above a smaller double row of elements ."
9224,"The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks : the s-block to the left , the p-block to the right , the d-block in the middle , and the f-block below that ."
9225,"The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns of the s- , d- , and p-blocks are called groups , with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases ."
9226,"Since , by definition , a periodic table incorporates recurring trends , any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new , yet to be discovered or synthesized , elements ."
9227,"As a result , a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior , and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences ."
9228,"Although precursors exist , Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication , in 1869 , of the first widely recognized periodic table ."
9229,He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements .
9230,Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table .
9231,Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered .
9232,Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior .
9233,All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized .
9234,"The elements from 1 to 98 ( californium ) have been found to exist naturally , although some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratories ."
9235,The elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratories .
9236,"Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued , with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate ."
9237,Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories .

9254,"Nolan 's inspiration for the film was the Joker 's comic book debut in 1940 , the 1988 graphic novel , and the 1996 series , which retold Two-Face 's origin ."
9255,"The nickname `` the Dark Knight '' was first applied to Batman in Batman No . 1 ( 1940 ) , in a story written by Bill Finger ."
9256,"The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago , as well as in several other locations in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Hong Kong ."
9257,"Nolan used an IMAX camera to film some sequences , including the Joker 's first appearance in the film ."
9258,"On January 22 , 2008 , some months after he had completed filming on The Dark Knight and six months before the film 's release , Heath Ledger died from a toxic combination of prescription drugs , leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public ."
9259,"Warner Bros. had initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight , developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker , but after Ledger 's death , the studio refocused its promotional campaign ."

9281,The dashed lines represent subdivisions within a major class .
9282,"For instance the `` Underweight '' classification is further divided into `` severe '' , `` moderate '' , and `` mild '' subclasses ."
9283,"The body mass index ( BMI ) , or Quetelet index , is a measure for human body shape based on an individual 's weight and height ."
9284,It was devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing `` social physics '' .
9285,Body mass index is defined as the individual 's body mass divided by the square of their height .
9286,The formulae universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure of kg/m2 .
9287,"BMI can also be determined using a BMI chart , which displays BMI as a function of weight ( horizontal axis ) and height ( vertical axis ) using contour lines for different values of BMI or colors for different BMI categories ."

9291,"As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution , he inspired the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain ."
9292,His ideas reflected Enlightenment era rhetoric of transnational human rights .
9293,"He has been called `` a corsetmaker by trade , a journalist by profession , and a propagandist by inclination . ''"
9294,"Born in Thetford , England , in the county of Norfolk , Paine emigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of Benjamin Franklin and he arrived in time to participate in the American Revolution ."
9295,"His principal contributions were the powerful , widely read pamphlet Common Sense ( 1776 ) , the all-time best-selling American book that advocated colonial America 's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain , and The American Crisis ( 1776–83 ) , a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series ."
9296,"Common Sense was so influential that John Adams said , `` Without the pen of the author of Common Sense , the sword of Washington would have been raised in vain.”"
9297,"Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s , becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution ."
9298,"He wrote the Rights of Man ( 1791 ) , in part a defence of the French Revolution against its critics ."
9299,His attacks on British writer Edmund Burke led to a trial and conviction in absentia in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel .
9300,"In 1792 , despite not being able to speak French , he was elected to the French National Convention ."
9301,The Girondists regarded him as an ally .
9302,"Consequently , the Montagnards , especially Robespierre , regarded him as an enemy ."
9303,"In December 1793 , he was arrested and imprisoned in Paris , then released in 1794 ."
9304,"He became notorious because of The Age of Reason ( 1793–94 ) , his book that advocates deism , promotes reason and freethinking , and argues against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular ."
9305,"He also wrote the pamphlet Agrarian Justice ( 1795 ) , discussing the origins of property , and introduced the concept of a guaranteed minimum income ."

9307,Only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity .
9308,"Clinical trials are sets of tests in medical research and drug development that generate safety and efficacy data ( or more specifically , information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments ) for health interventions ( e.g. , drugs , diagnostics , devices , therapy protocols ) ."
9309,"They are conducted only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non clinical safety , and health authority/ethics committee approval is granted in the country where approval of the drug or device is sought ."
9310,"Previously , many emerging countries did not require local trials for product approvals ."
9311,"Now , though emerging countries still accept data from U.S./Europe , they also require some local trials ."
9312,"Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development , investigators initially enroll volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies , and subsequently conduct larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with others already approved for the affliction of interest ."
9313,"As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered , the number of patients is typically increased ."
9314,"Clinical trials can vary in size , and can involve a single research entity in one country or many such entities in multiple countries ."
9315,"A full series of trials may incur sizable costs , and the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor , which may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical , biotechnology or medical device company ."
9316,"When the diversity of required support roles exceeds the resources of the sponsor , a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner , such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector ."

9320,"The Packers are the only non-profit , community-owned major league professional sports team in the United States ."
9321,The Packers are the last vestige of `` small town teams '' that were once common in the NFL during the 1920s and 1930s .
9322,"Founded in 1919 by Earl `` Curly '' Lambeau ( hence the name Lambeau Field on which the team plays ) and George Whitney Calhoun , the Green Bay Packers can trace their lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896 ."
9323,In 1919 and 1920 the Packers competed as a semi-professional football team against clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest .
9324,"They joined the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) in 1921 , the forerunner to what is known today as the National Football League ( NFL ) ."
9325,"Although Green Bay is the last NFL `` small town '' team , its local fan base and media extends into nearby Milwaukee ; the team also played selected home games there between 1933 and 1994 ."
9326,"The Green Bay Packers have won 13 league championships ( more than any other team in the NFL ) , including nine NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowl victories —in 1967 ( Super Bowl I ) , 1968 ( Super Bowl II ) , 1997 ( Super Bowl XXXI ) and 2011 ( Super Bowl XLV ) ."

9329,"Ethanol fuel is ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) , the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages ."
9330,"It is most often used as a motor fuel , mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline ."
9331,World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17 billion to more than 52 billion liters .
9332,"From 2007 to 2008 , the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7 % to 5.4 % ."
9333,"In 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached 22.36 billion U.S. liquid gallons ( bg ) ( 84.6 billion liters ) , with the United States as the top producer with 13.9 bg ( 52.6 billion liters ) , accounting for 62.2 % of global production , followed by Brazil with 5.6 bg ( 21.1 billion liters ) ."
9334,"Ethanol fuel has a `` gasoline gallon equivalency `` ( GGE ) value of , which means 1.5 gallons of ethanol produce the energy of one gallon of gasoline ."
9335,"Ethanol fuel is widely used in Brazil and in the United States , and together both countries were responsible for 87.1 % of the world 's ethanol fuel production in 2011 ."
9336,"Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10 % ethanol , and ethanol represented 10 % of the U.S. gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011 ."
9337,"Since 1976 the Brazilian government has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline , and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25 % ethanol and 75 % gasoline ( E25 ) ."
9338,By December 2011 Brazil had a fleet of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles that regularly use neat ethanol fuel ( known as E100 ) .
9339,Bioethanol is a form of renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks .
9340,"It can be made from very common crops such as sugar cane , potato , manioc and corn ."
9341,There has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol will be in replacing gasoline .
9342,"Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops , as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production , especially from corn ."
9343,Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns .
9344,"Cellulosic ethanol offers promise because cellulose fibers , a major and universal component in plant cells walls , can be used to produce ethanol ."
9345,"According to the International Energy Agency , cellulosic ethanol could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought ."

9353,They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth ( cochlea ) .
9354,The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe hearing loss .
9355,"The term `` ossicles '' literally means `` tiny bones '' and commonly refers to the auditory ossicles , though the term may refer to any small bone throughout the body ."
9356,"The New Covenant ( Hebrew • • — Greek • • diatheke kaine ) is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah , in the Hebrew Scriptures ."
9357,It is often thought of as an eschatological Messianic Age or world to come and is related to the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God .
9358,"Generally , Christians believe that the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist , which in the Gospel of John includes the New Commandment ."
9359,"There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant , as an example an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ ; that is , it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts , but in the future external world as well ."
9360,The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament with the saying : `` this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood '' .
9361,"Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant , and that the Blood of Christ shed at his crucifixion is the required blood of the covenant ."
9362,"As with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible , the New Covenant is considered `` a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God . ''"
9363,It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ as spoken during his Sermon on the Mount .

9593,Sample of a Medallion signature guarantee stampIn
9594,"the United States and Canada , a medallion signature guarantee is a special signature guarantee for the transfer of securities ."
9595,It is a guarantee by the transferring financial institution that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any forgery .
9596,Signature guarantees protect shareholders by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible investor losses .
9597,They also limit the liability of the transfer agent who accepts the certificates .
9598,Different institutions have different policies as to what type of identification they require to provide the guarantee and whether they charge a fee for such service ( usually nominal if any ) .
9599,Most institutions will not guarantee a signature of someone who has not already been their customer .
9600,"A medallion signature guarantee is not the same as an acknowledgment by a notary public , in the sense that a `` signature guarantee '' is a certification by the institution that the signature is authentic , and an acknowledgment is a certification by a notary public attesting that the signer signed a document voluntarily ."
9601,"Some banks may no longer provide this service , however , many still do as well as other financial institutions such as a Savings and Loans and Credit Unions ."
9602,"At their sole discretion , these institutions may still decline to provide the Medallion Signature Guarantees ."

9605,The General Motors streetcar conspiracy ( also known as the Great American streetcar scandal ) refers to allegations and convictions in relation to a program by General Motors ( GM ) and other companies who purchased and then dismantled streetcar and electric train systems in many American cities .
9606,"Between 1936 and 1950 , National City Lines and Pacific City Lines —with investment from GM , Firestone Tire , Standard Oil of California , Phillips Petroleum , Mack Trucks , and the Federal Engineering Corporation—bought over 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities including Baltimore , Newark , Los Angeles , New York City , Oakland and San Diego and converted them into bus operation ."
9607,Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies .
9608,"Some suggest that this program played a key role in the decline of public transit in cities across the United States ; notably Edwin J. Quinby , who first drew attention to the program in 1946 , and then Bradford C. Snell , an anti-trust attorney for the United States Senate whose controversial 1974 testimony to a Senate inquiry brought the issue to national awareness ."
9609,Both Quinby and Snell argued that the deliberate destruction of streetcars was part of a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency .
9610,"Others say that independent economic factors brought about changes in the transit system , including the Great Depression , the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 , labor unrest , market forces , rapidly increasing traffic congestion , urban sprawl , taxation policies that favored private vehicle ownership , and general enthusiasm for the automobile ."
9611,"One writer on the subject has suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic conspiracy theory thinking , bordering on paranoid delusions saying `` Clearly , GM waged a war on electric traction ."
9612,"It was indeed an all out assault , but by no means the single reason for the failure of rapid transit ."
9613,"Also , it is just as clear that actions and inactions by government contributed significantly to the elimination of electric traction . ''"
9614,"Only a small handful of U.S. cities have surviving effective rail-based urban transport systems based on streetcars or trams , including Newark , Philadelphia , San Francisco , Pittsburgh , and Boston ; others are re-introducing them ."

9800,"Rather than exercising his rank , Warren served in the battle as a private soldier , and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed 's Hill ."
9801,"His death , immortalized in John Trumbull 's painting , The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker 's Hill , June 17 , 1775 , galvanized the rebel forces , and he has been memorialized in many place names in the United States ."
9802,STM image of self-assembled supramolecular chains of the organic semiconductor Quinacridone on Graphite .
9803,"An organic semiconductor is an organic material with semiconductor properties , that is , with an electrical conductivity between that of insulators and that of metals ."
9804,"Single molecules , short chain ( oligomers ) and organic polymers can be semiconductive ."
9805,"Semiconducting small molecules ( aromatic hydrocarbons ) include the polycyclic aromatic compounds pentacene , anthracene , and rubrene ."
9806,"Polymeric organic semiconductors include poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) , poly ( p-phenylene vinylene ) , as well as polyacetylene and its derivatives ."
9807,There are two major overlapping classes of organic semiconductors .
9808,These are organic charge-transfer complexes and various linear-backbone conductive polymers derived from polyacetylene .
9809,"Linear backbone organic semiconductors include polyacetylene itself and its derivatives polypyrrole , and polyaniline ."
9810,"At least locally , charge-transfer complexes often exhibit similar conduction mechanisms to inorganic semiconductors ."
9811,Such mechanisms arise from the presence of hole and electron conduction layers separated by a band gap .
9812,"While such classic mechanisms are important locally , as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors , tunnelling , localized states , mobility gaps , and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction , particularly in polyacetylenes ."
9813,"Like inorganic semiconductors , organic semiconductors can be doped ."
9814,Organic semiconductors susceptible to doping such as polyaniline ( Ormecon ) and are also known as organic metals .
9815,Typical current carriers in organic semiconductors are holes and electrons in π-bonds .
9816,Almost all organic solids are insulators .
9817,"But when their constituent molecules have π-conjugate systems , electrons can move via π-electron cloud overlaps , especially by hopping , tunnelling and related mechanisms ."
9818,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalocyanine salt crystals are examples of this type of organic semiconductor .
9819,"Mainly due to low mobility , even unpaired electrons may be stable in charge-transfer complexes ."
9820,Such unpaired electrons can function as current carriers .
9821,This type of semiconductor is also obtained by pairing an electron donor molecule with an electron acceptor molecule .

9832,'Son of man ' is the translation of various Hebrew and Greek phrases used in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament .
9833,"It has diverse meanings , ranging from a normal human being to a prophesied eternal , divine ruler ."
9834,The Hebrew expression `` son of man '' ( בן–אדם i.e . ben-'adam ) appears one hundred and seven times in the Hebrew Bible .
9835,This is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular but is used mostly in Ezekiel ( 93 times ) and 14 times elsewhere .
9836,"In thirty two cases the phrase appears in intermediate plural form `` sons of men '' , i.e . human beings ."
9837,"As generally interpreted by Jews , it denotes humankind generally ."
9838,"In the Koine Greek of the New Testament , `` the son of man '' is invariably used as `` ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου '' with a definite article ."
9839,"The use of the definite article in `` the son of man '' in the Christian gospels is novel , and before its use there , no records of its use in any of the surviving Greek documents of antiquity exist ."
9840,Geza Vermes has stated that `` the Son of man '' in the Christian gospels is unrelated to Hebrew Bible usages .
9841,"In Christian usage , unlike the Son of God title , which has been an essential element of Christian creeds since the Apostolic age , the proclamation of `` Jesus as the Son of man '' has never been an article of faith in Christianity ."
9842,The interpretation of the use of `` the Son of man '' in the New Testament has remained challenging and after 150 years of debate no consensus on the issue has emerged among scholars .
9843,"Master of foxhounds leads the field from Powderham Castle in Devon , England , with the hounds in front ."

9845,"Fox hunting originated in the form practised until recently in the United Kingdom in the 16th century , but is practised all over the world , including in Australia , Canada , France , Ireland , Italy and the United States ."
9846,"In Australia , the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms similar to spotlighting or deer hunting ."
9847,"In much of the world hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons ( e.g. , deer hunting with bow and arrow ) ; in Britain and Ireland , `` hunting '' without qualification implies fox hunting ( or other forms of hunting with hounds- beagling , stag hunting , mink hunting , drag hunting or hunting the clean boot ) as described here ."
9848,"The sport is controversial , particularly in the UK , where it was banned in Scotland in 2002 , and in England and Wales in November 2004 ( law enforced from February 2005 ) , though shooting foxes as vermin remained legal ."
9849,"Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control , while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary ."

9901,Uncooked Rouladen
9902,"Rouladen ( or Rinderroulade , singular : roulade ) is a German meat roulade usually consisting of bacon , onions , mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then cooked ."
9903,"In some countries , the roulade is also known as `` beef olive '' ."
9904,"Beef or veal is used as meat though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version was probably venison or pork , and pork is still popular in some areas ."
9905,The beef rouladen as we know them today have become popular over the last century .
9906,The cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut .
9907,"The more expensive version would be the round steak , also known as rump steak ."

9913,Countries by 2011 GDP ( nominal ) according to the CIA World Factbook .
9914,"This article includes a list of countries in the world sorted by their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year ."
9915,The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates .
9916,"Several economies which are not considered to be countries ( world , the EU , and some dependent territories ) are included in the lists because they appear in the sources ."
9917,"These economies are not ranked in the charts here , but are listed where applicable ."
9918,"The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries , and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's currency ."
9919,"Such fluctuations may change a country 's ranking from one year to the next , even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population ."
9920,Therefore these figures should be used with caution .
9921,Some countries/regions may have citizens which are on average wealthy .
9922,These countries/regions could appear in this list as having a small GDP .
9923,"This would be because the country/region listed has a small population , and therefore small total economy ; the GDP is calculated as the population times the wealth per capita ."
9924,"Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries ."
9925,( See List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) )
9926,"PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem , but has its own drawbacks ; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade , and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP ."
9927,"On the whole , PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures ."
9928,The first list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division for 2011 .
9929,The second list largely includes data ( estimate ) compiled by the International Monetary Fund for 2012 .
9930,"The third list shows the World Bank 's mostly 2011 estimates , and the fourth list includes mostly 2012 estimates from the CIA World Factbook ."
9931,"Lapping is a machining process , in which two surfaces are rubbed together with an abrasive between them , by hand movement or by way of a machine ."
9932,This can take two forms .
9933,"The first type of lapping ( traditionally called grinding ) , typically involves rubbing a brittle material such as glass against a surface such as iron or glass itself ( also known as the `` lap '' or grinding tool ) with an abrasive such as aluminum oxide , jeweller 's rouge , optician 's rouge , emery , silicon carbide , diamond , etc. , in between them ."
9934,This produces microscopic conchoidal fractures as the abrasive rolls about between the two surfaces and removes material from both .
9935,"The other form of lapping involves a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap , which is `` charged '' with the abrasive ."
9936,The lap is then used to cut a harder material—the workpiece .
9937,The abrasive embeds within the softer material which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material .
9938,"Taken to a finer limit , this will produce a polished surface such as with a polishing cloth on an automobile , or a polishing cloth or polishing pitch upon glass or steel ."
9939,"Taken to the ultimate limit , with the aid of accurate interferometry and specialized polishing machines or skilled hand polishing , lensmakers can produce surfaces that are flat to better than 30 nanometers ."
9940,This is one twentieth of the wavelength of light from the commonly used 632.8 nm helium neon laser light source .
9941,Surfaces this flat can be molecularly bonded ( optically contacted ) by bringing them together under the right conditions .
9942,"( This is not the same as the wringing effect of Johansson blocks , although it is similar ) ."
9943,The term `` America 's Team '' is a popular nickname in the United States that refers to the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League .

9954,"A pickup truck or pick-up , often simply referred to as a pickup , is a light motor vehicle with an open-top , rear cargo area ( bed ) ."
9955,"In North America , the term pickup is used for light trucks with a lighter duty chassis and factory built , integrated bed , as well as for coupé utility vehicles , often based on a personal car chassis , but also often on a special dedicated chassi for such use ."
9956,"Some countries have their own terms similar to pickup , such as ute in Australia and New Zealand , or bakkie in South Africa ."
9957,"Large pickup trucks are somewhat rare in Europe , where vans and light lorries are commonly used for similar roles ."
9958,Bottled mineral water
9959,"Bottled water is drinking water ( e.g. , well water , distilled water , Mineral water , or spring water ) packaged in plastic or glass water bottles ."

9961,Sizes range from small single serving bottles to large carboys for water coolers .
9962,"Map of the major rivers , lakes , and reservoirs in India"
9963,Map showing rivers and flood prone areas in India
9964,Rivers of India play an important role in the lives of the Indian people .
9965,"The river systems provide irrigation , potable water , cheap transportation , electricity , and the livelihoods for a large number of people all over the country and to rural areas ."
9966,This easily explains why nearly all the major cities of India are located by the banks of rivers .
9967,The rivers also have an important role in Hindu mythology and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country .
9968,Seven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India .
9969,"Most of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal ; however , some of the rivers whose courses take them through the western part of the country and towards the east of the state of Himachal Pradesh empty into the Arabian Sea ."
9970,"Parts of Ladakh , northern parts of the Aravlli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert have inland drainage ."
9971,Dr.Francis Buchanan surveyed the courses of the rivers of India along with their tributaries and branches in 1810-11 AD and presented a minute account of it .
9972,The shifting of the courses and bed over the centuries is very remarkable .
9973,"Many of the channels mentioned in that survey have now become dead , dried or even extinct ."
9974,All major rivers of India originate from one of the three main watersheds :
9975,The Himalaya and the Karakoram ranges
9976,Vindhya and Satpura ranges and Chotanagpur plateau in central India
9977,Sahyadri or Western Ghats in western India
9978,The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states in the mid-20th century .
9979,The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation-states .
9980,"Preparing to rebuild the international economic system as World War II was still raging , 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , United States , for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference ."
9981,"The delegates deliberated during 1–22 July 1944 , and signed the Agreement on its final day ."
9982,"Setting up a system of rules , institutions , and procedures to regulate the international monetary system , the planners at Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , which today is part of the World Bank Group ."
9983,These organizations became operational in 1945 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement .
9984,The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U.S. dollar and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments .
9985,"On 15 August 1971 , the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US $ to gold ."
9986,This brought the Bretton Woods system to an end and saw the dollar become fiat currency .
9987,"This action , referred to as the Nixon shock , created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states ."
9988,"At the same time , many fixed currencies ( such as GBP , for example ) , also became free floating ."
9989,Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. is an Italian company that designs and manufactures motorcycles .
9990,"Headquartered in Bologna , Italy , Ducati is owned by Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini ."
9991,"A credit score is a numerical expression based on a statistical analysis of a person 's credit files , to represent the creditworthiness of that person ."
9992,A credit score is primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit bureaus .
9993,"Lenders , such as banks and credit card companies , use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt ."
9994,"Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan , at what interest rate , and what credit limits ."
9995,Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue .
9996,The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system .
9997,Credit scoring is not limited to banks .
9998,"Other organizations , such as mobile phone companies , insurance companies , landlords , and government departments employ the same techniques ."
9999,"Credit scoring also has a lot of overlap with data mining , which uses many similar techniques ."
10000,These techniques combine thousands of factors but they are more or less similar or the same .
10001,"The seven SI base units and the interdependency of their definitions : for example , to extract the definition of the metre from the speed of light , the definition of the second must be known while the ampere and candela are both dependent on the definition of energy which in turn is defined in terms of length , mass and time ."
10002,The International System of Units ( SI ) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units are derived .
10003,These SI base units and their physical quantities are:
10004,metre for length ( US English : meter )
10005,kilogram for mass ( note : not the gram )
10006,second for time
10007,ampere for electric current
10008,kelvin for temperature
10009,candela for luminous intensity
10010,mole for the amount of substance .
10011,The SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology .
10012,"However , in a given realization of these units they may well be interdependent , i.e . defined in terms of each other ."
10013,"The names of SI units are written in lowercase characters ( the 'degree Celsius ' meets this rule , as 'degree ' is the unit , and 'Celsius ' is a modifier ) ."
10014,"The symbols of units are written in lowercase ( e.g . metre has the symbol m ) , except that symbols for units named after persons are written with an initial capital letter ( e.g. , the hertz has the uppercase symbol Hz ) ."
10015,"Many other units , such as the litre ( US English : liter ) , are formally not part of the SI , but are accepted for use with SI ."
10016,Monument Canyon
10017,"Colorado National Monument ( locally referred to as The Monument ) is a part of the National Park Service near the city of Grand Junction , Colorado ."
10018,"Spectacular canyons cut deep into sandstone and even granite–gneiss–schist rock formations , in some areas ."
10019,"This is an area of desert land high on the Colorado Plateau , with pinion and juniper forests on the plateau ."
10020,"The park hosts a wide range of wildlife , including red-tailed hawks and golden eagles , ravens , jays , desert bighorn sheep , and coyotes ."

10238,"On most modern western fretted instruments , frets are metal strips inserted into the fingerboard ."
10239,"On some historical instruments and non-European instruments , frets are made of pieces of string tied around the neck ."
10240,Frets divide the neck into fixed segments at intervals related to a musical framework .
10241,"On instruments such as guitars , each fret represents one semitone in the standard western system where one octave is divided into twelve semitones ."
10242,"Fret is often used as a verb , meaning simply `` to press down the string behind a fret . ''"
10243,Fretting often refers to the frets and/or their system of placement .
10244,There was consumption of alcohol both during and after prohibition .
10245,"The 18th Amendment prohibited the production , distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States and was widely supported by the American public when it went into effect in 1920 ."
10246,"The temperance movement had popularized the belief that alcohol was the major cause of most personal and social problems and prohibition was seen as the solution to the nation 's poverty , crime , violence , and other ills ."
10247,"Upon ratification of the amendment , the famous evangelist Billy Sunday said that `` The slums will soon be only a memory ."
10248,We will turn our prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses and corncribs . ''
10249,( Compare Christianity and alcohol . )
10250,"Since alcohol was to be banned and since it was seen as the cause of most , if not all , crime , some communities sold their jails ."
10251,The nation was highly optimistic and the leading prohibitionist in the United States Congress confidently asserted that `` There is as much chance of repealing the Eighteenth Amendment as there is for a hummingbird to fly to the planet Mars with the Washington Monument tied to its tail.”
10252,"The metre ( meter in American English ) , ( SI unit symbol : m ; SI dimension symbol : L ) , is the fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) ."
10253,"Originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth 's equator to the North Pole ( at sea level ) , its definition has been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology ."
10254,"Since 1983 , it has been defined as `` the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . ''"

10257,A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes and history that has shaped it .
10258,Geologists usually engage in studying geology .
10259,"Geologists , studying more of an applied science than a theoretical one , must approach Geology using physics , chemistry and biology as well as other sciences ."
10260,"Geologists , compared to scientists engaged in other fields , are generally more exposed to the outdoors than staying in laboratories ; although some geologists prefer to perform most of their studies in the lab ."
10261,"Geologists are engaged in exploration for mining companies in search of metals , oils , and other Earth resources ."
10262,"They are also in the forefront of natural hazards and disasters warning and mitigation , studying earthquakes , volcanic activity , tsunamis , weather storms , and the like ; their studies are used to warn the general public of the occurrence of these events ."
10263,"Currently , geologists are also engaged in the discussion of climate change , as they study the history and evidence for this Earth process ."

10265,"Modern vacuum tubes , mostly miniature style"
10266,"In electronics , a vacuum tube , electron tube ( in North America ) , thermionic valve , tube , or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container ."
10267,The container is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shape .
10268,"The simplest vacuum tube , the diode , is essentially an incandescent light bulb with an added electrode inside ."
10269,"When the bulb 's filament is heated white-hot , electrons are `` boiled '' off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulb ."
10270,"If the electrode -- called a `` plate '' or `` anode '' -- is made more positive than the hot filament , a direct current flows through the vacuum to the electrode ( a demonstration of the Edison effect ) ."
10271,"As the current only flows in one direction , it makes it possible to convert an alternating current applied to the filament to direct current ."
10272,"The introduction of a third electrode , a grid between the filament and the plate , yields another function ."
10273,A voltage applied to the grid controls the current flowing from the filament to the plate .
10274,"Thus , it allows the device to be used as an electronic amplifier ."
10275,"Vacuum tubes are thus used for rectification , amplification , switching , or similar processing or creation of electrical signals ."
10276,"The vast majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a vacuum inside , and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament ."
10277,Some exceptions to this are dealt with in the section about gas-filled tubes below .
10278,"Vacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology , which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting , television , radar , sound reinforcement , sound recording and reproduction , large telephone networks , analog and digital computers , and industrial process control ."
10279,"Although some applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter or mechanical computers , it was the invention of the vacuum tube with three electrodes ( called a triode ) and its capability of electronic amplification that made these technologies widespread and practical ."
10280,"In most applications , solid-state devices such as transistors and other semiconductor devices have replaced tubes ."
10281,"Solid-state devices last longer and are smaller , more efficient , more reliable , and cheaper than tubes ."
10282,"Tubes can be fragile , sometimes generate significant unwanted heat , and can take many seconds—many minutes in critical applications—after powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational tolerance ."
10283,"However , tubes still find uses where solid-state devices have not been developed , are impractical , or where a tube has superior performance , as with some devices in professional audio and high-power radio transmitters ."
10284,Tubes are still produced for such applications .
10285,Tubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the electromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares .

10302,"After the War , Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative ( Baldwin ) government of 1924–29 , controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy ."
10303,Also controversial was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII .
10304,"Out of office and politically `` in the wilderness '' during the 1930s , Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament ."
10305,"On the outbreak of the Second World War , he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty ."
10306,"Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 , Churchill became Prime Minister ."
10307,"His steadfast refusal to consider defeat , surrender , or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance , especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone among European countries in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler ."
10308,"Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts , which helped inspire the British people ."
10309,He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured .

10326,There are different types of media for growing different types of cells .
10327,"There are two major types of growth media : those used for cell culture , which use specific cell types derived from plants or animals , and microbiological culture , which are used for growing microorganisms , such as bacteria or yeast ."
10328,The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates ; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth .
10329,"Some organisms , termed fastidious organisms , require specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements ."
10330,"Viruses , for example , are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth medium containing living cells ."
10331,"A talent agent , or booking agent , is a person who finds jobs for actors , authors , film directors , musicians , models , producers , professional athletes , writers and other people in various entertainment businesses ."
10332,"An agent also defends , supports and promotes the interest of his/her clients ."
10333,Agents can not produce their own shows due to conflict of interest .
10334,A talent agent must be familiar with their clients .
10335,An agent has to know what kind of work the client can and can not do in order to match them with various jobs .
10336,"Having an agent is not required , but does help the artist in getting jobs ."
10337,"In many cases casting directors , or other businesses , go to talent agencies to find artists they are looking for ."
10338,The agent is paid a percentage of the star 's earnings ( typically 10 % ) .
10339,Agents sometimes will be referred to as `` 10 percenters . ''
10340,There are different regulations that govern different types of agents that are established by artist 's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates .
10341,There are also professional organizations that license talent agencies .
10342,"Since the decline in viewership in theaters , from the 1950s to 1960s , this caused a monumental shift in how studios would produce films and thus reducing the cost of exclusive and expensive actors ."
10343,Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios .
10344,"Because of this , agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option ."
10345,"Agents now became third parties that negotiated between studios and clients , this making their services imperative between each party ."
10346,"Since talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts , all talent agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code , which calls an agent a `` person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring , offering , promising , or attempting to procure employment for artist or artists .

10418,"A variable-rate mortgage , adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) , or tracker mortgage is a mortgage loan with the interest rate on the note periodically adjusted based on an index which reflects the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets ."
10419,The loan may be offered at the lender 's standard variable rate/ base rate .
10420,"There may be a direct and legally-defined link to the underlying index , but where the lender offers no specific link to the underlying market or index the rate can be changed at the lender 's discretion ."
10421,"The term `` variable-rate mortgage '' is most common outside the United States , whilst in the United States , `` adjustable-rate mortgage '' is most common , and implies a mortgage regulated by the Federal government , with caps on charges ."
10422,"In many countries , adjustable rate mortgages are the norm , and in such places , may simply be referred to as mortgages ."
10423,"Among the most common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury ( CMT ) securities , the Cost of Funds Index ( COFI ) , and the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) ."
10424,"A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index , rather than using other indices ."
10425,"This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender , whose own cost of funding will usually be related to the index ."
10426,"Consequently , payments made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate ( alternatively , the term of the loan may change ) ."
10427,"This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage , which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate ."
10428,"Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest only mortgage , the fixed rate mortgage , the negative amortization mortgage , and the balloon payment mortgage ."
10429,Adjustable rates transfer part of the interest rate risk from the lender to the borrower .
10430,They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain .
10431,The borrower benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases .
10432,The borrower benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages .

10477,A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a satellite .
10478,"More explicitly , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation , but that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of other objects ."
10479,"The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun , brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-Neptunian objects that rivaled Pluto in size , and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object , Eris ."
10480,"This classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighbourhood of their orbit are defined as planets , while those that are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as small Solar System bodies ."
10481,Dwarf planets come in between .
10482,"The exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the IAU has been both praised and criticized ; it was said to be the `` right decision '' by Mike Brown , who discovered and other new dwarf planets , but has been rejected by Alan Stern , who had coined the term dwarf planet in 1990 ."
10483,"The IAU currently recognizes five dwarf planets in the Solar System : , Pluto , , , and ."
10484,"However , only two of these bodies , Ceres and Pluto , have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they fit the definition ."
10485,Eris has been accepted as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto .
10486,The IAU subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 ( and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1 ) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets .
10487,"The only two such objects known at the time , Makemake and Haumea , went through this naming procedure and were declared to be dwarf planets ."
10488,It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets .
10489,"Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored , and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered ."
10490,"Individual astronomers recognize several of these , and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects , ranging from `` nearly certain '' to `` possible '' dwarf planets . '"
10491,"Brown identifies nine known objects – the five accepted by the IAU plus , , , and – as `` virtually certain '' , with another two dozen highly likely , and there are probably a hundred or so such objects in total ."
10492,The classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed .
10493,A debit card ( also known as a bank card or check card ) is a plastic payment card that provides the cardholder electronic access to his or her bank account ( s ) at a financial institution .
10494,"Some cards have a stored value with which a payment is made , while most relay a message to the cardholder 's bank to withdraw funds from a payee 's designated bank account ."
10495,"The card , where accepted , can be used instead of cash when making purchases ."
10496,"In some cases , the primary account number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card ."
10497,"In many countries , the use of debit cards has become so widespread that their volume has overtaken or entirely replaced cheques and , in some instances , cash transactions ."
10498,"The development of debit cards , unlike credit cards and charge cards , has generally been country specific resulting in a number of different systems around the world , which were often incompatible ."
10499,"Since the mid-2000s , a number of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be used in other countries and allowed their use for internet and phone purchases ."
10500,"Unlike credit and charge cards , payments using a debit card are immediately transferred from the cardholder 's designated bank account , instead of them paying the money back at a later date ."
10501,"Debit cards usually also allow for instant withdrawal of cash , acting as the ATM card for withdrawing cash ."
10502,"Merchants may also offer cashback facilities to customers , where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase ."
10503,"Francois Henri `` Jack '' LaLanne ( September 26 , 1914 - January 23 , 2011 ) was an American fitness , exercise , and nutritional expert and motivational speaker who is sometimes called `` the godfather of fitness '' and the `` first fitness superhero . ''"
10504,He described himself as being a `` sugarholic '' and a `` junk food junkie '' until he was 15 .
10505,"He also had behavioral problems , but `` turned his life around '' after listening to a public lecture by Paul Bragg , a well-known nutrition speaker ."
10506,"During his career , he came to believe that the country 's overall health depended on the health of its population , writing that `` physical culture and nutrition — is the salvation of America . ''"
10507,"Decades before health and fitness began being promoted by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons , LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet ."
10508,He published numerous books on fitness and hosted a fitness television show between 1953 and 1985 .
10509,"As early as 1936 , at age 21 , he opened one of the nation 's first fitness gyms in Oakland , California , which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms using his name ."
10510,"One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women , whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs ."
10511,"He invented a number of exercise machines , including leg-extension and pulley devices ."
10512,"Besides producing his own series of videos , he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise , believing it would enable them to enhance their strength ."
10513,"LaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder , as well as for his prodigious feats of strength ."
10514,"Arnold Schwarzenegger once stated , `` That Jack LaLanne 's an animal ! , '' after LaLanne , at 54 , beat a 21-year-old Schwarzenegger `` badly '' in an informal contest ."
10515,"On the occasion of LaLanne 's death , Schwarzenegger credited LaLanne for being `` an apostle for fitness '' by inspiring `` billions all over the world to live healthier lives , '' and , as governor of California , had earlier placed him on his Governor 's Council on Physical Fitness ."
10516,Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim waist .
10517,He was inducted to the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
10518,Air forces of most of the countries use system similar to Armies .
10519,"However , the RAF and the air forces of many Commonwealth countries , or those formerly under a British influence , use a different set of ranks loosely based on naval equivalents ; Lieutenant , Commander , Captain and Commodore are prefixed for air force use with Flight , Wing , Group and Air , respectively ( the first three being the units that they used to command ) ."

10556,"Interstate 70 ( I-70 ) is an Interstate Highway in the United States that runs from Interstate 15 near Cove Fort , Utah , to a Park and Ride near Baltimore , Maryland ."
10557,It was the first Interstate Highway project in the United States .
10558,I-70 approximately traces the path of U.S. Route 40 ( and also the old National Road ) east of the Rocky Mountains .
10559,"West of the Rockies , the route of I-70 was derived from multiple sources ."
10560,"I-70 is the fifth longest Interstate Highway , after I-90 , I-80 , I-40 , and I-10 ."
10561,"The construction of I-70 in Colorado and Utah is considered an engineering marvel as the route passes through the Eisenhower Tunnel , Glenwood Canyon , and the San Rafael Swell ."
10562,The Eisenhower Tunnel is the highest point along the Interstate Highway system with an elevation of .
10563,The sections of the interstate in Missouri and Kansas have laid claim to be the first interstate in the United States .

10565,Photo of 1999 total eclipse
10566,"As seen from the Earth , a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth , and the Moon fully or partially blocks ( `` occults `` ) the Sun ."
10567,"This can happen only at new moon , when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy ."
10568,"In a total eclipse , the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon ."
10569,In partial and annular eclipses only part of the Sun is obscured .
10570,"If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit , a little closer to the Earth , and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every single month ."
10571,"However , the Moon 's orbit is inclined ( tilted ) at more than 5 degrees to Earth 's orbit around the Sun ( see ecliptic ) so its shadow at new moon usually misses Earth ."
10572,Earth 's orbit is called the ecliptic plane as the Moon 's orbit must cross this plane in order for an eclipse ( both solar as well as lunar ) to occur .
10573,"In addition , the Moon 's actual orbit is elliptical , often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun totally ."
10574,"The orbital planes cross each year at a line of nodes resulting in at least two , and up to five , solar eclipses occurring each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses ."
10575,"However , total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on Earth 's surface traced by the Moon 's shadow or umbra ."
10576,An eclipse is a natural phenomenon .
10577,"Nevertheless , in some ancient and modern cultures , solar eclipses have been attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens ."
10578,"A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation , as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes ."
10579,"Because it is dangerous to look directly at the Sun , observers should use special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques when viewing a partial eclipse , or the partial phases of a total eclipse ."
10580,"It is safe to view the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection , however ."
10581,People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses .
10582,"A political party ( from , Genitive partis , `` part '' , `` portion '' ) is a political organization that typically seeks to influence , or entirely control , government policy , usually by nominating candidates with aligned political views and trying to seat them in political office ."

10594,World map showing the Tropic of Cancer
10595,"The Tropic of Cancer , also referred to as the Northern tropic , is the circle of latitude on the Earth that marks the most northerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead at its zenith ."
10596,"This event occurs once per year , at the time of the June solstice , when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent ."
10597,It currently ( Year 2013 ) lies at 23° 26′ 15.143′′ north of the Equator .
10598,"Its Southern Hemisphere counterpart , marking the most southerly position at which the Sun may appear directly overhead , is the Tropic of Capricorn ."
10599,"These tropics are two of the five major degree measures or major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth , besides the Arctic and Antarctic Circles and the Equator ."
10600,The positions of these circles of latitude ( other than the Equator ) are dictated by the tilt of the Earth 's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit .
10601,"DVD-Video is a consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD discs , and is currently the dominant consumer video format in Asia , North America , Europe , and Australia ."

10609,"In computing and specifically Internet , a leech is one who benefits , usually deliberately , from others ' information or effort but does not offer anything in return , or makes only token offerings in an attempt to avoid being called a leech ."
10610,"In economics , this type of behavior is called `` free riding '' and is associated with the free rider problem ."
10611,"Depending on context , leeching does not necessarily refer to illegal use of computer resources , but often instead to greedy use according to etiquette : to wit , using too much of what is freely given without contributing a reasonable amount back to the community that provides it ."
10612,"The name derives from the leech , an animal that sucks blood and then tries to leave unnoticed ."
10613,"Other terms are used , such as `` freeloader '' , but leech is the most common ."

10616,It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution .
10617,"The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress , where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general ."
10618,The cabinet-level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin 's operation and transformed into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act .
10619,"The USPS employs over 574,000 workers and operates over 260,000 vehicles ."
10620,The USPS is the operator of the largest vehicle fleet in the world .
10621,"The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans , regardless of geography , at uniform price and quality ."
10622,"The USPS has exclusive access to letter boxes marked `` U.S. Mail '' and personal letterboxes in the United States , but still competes against private package delivery services , such as UPS and FedEx ."
10623,The USPS has not directly received taxpayer-dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters .
10624,"Since the 2006 all-time peak mail volume , after which Congress passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act `` , ( which mandated $ 5.5 billion per year to be paid into an account to pre-fund retiree health-care , 75 years into the future , a requirement unique among organizations and businesses in the U.S. ) , revenue dropped sharply due to recession-influenced declining mail volume , prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting costs to reduce its budget deficit ."

10628,Princess cut diamond set in a ring
10629,"The Princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds , next to a round brilliant ."
10630,The face-up shape of the princess cut is square or rectangular and the profile or side-on shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sides .
10631,"The princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut , having been created in the 1960s ."
10632,"It has gained in popularity in recent years as a more distinctive alternative to the more popular round brilliant cut , in which the top of diamond , called the crown , is cut with a round face-up shape and the bottom , called the pavilion , is shaped similar to a cone ."
10633,A princess cut with the same width as the diameter of a round brilliant will weigh more as it has four corners which would otherwise have been cut off and rounded to form a round brilliant .
10634,The princess cut is sometimes referred to as a square modified brilliant .
10635,"However , while displaying the same high degree of brilliance , its faceting style is unique and completely different from that of a round brilliant ."
10636,"The Princess cut had its origins in the early `` French '' cut , having a step-modified `` Double-French '' or `` Cross '' cut crown and a series of unique , chevron-shaped facets in the pavilion which combine to give a distinct cross-shaped reflection when the stone is viewed directly through the table ."
10637,"Effectively , the Princess cut combines the high degree of light return of a round brilliant cut with a distinctive square or rectangular shape ."
10638,"The square princess cut diamond is usually slightly cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds of the same carat weight because it retains about 80 % of the rough diamond , as opposed to the round brilliant which retains only about 50 % of the rough ."
10639,The ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters .
10640,Accredited Gem Appraisers ( AGA ) and American Gem Society Laboratory ( AGSL ) and European Gem Laboratories-USA ( EGL-USA ) are currently the only labs that grade the Princess cut for cut .
10641,There is no universal definition of what measurements make an ideal princess cut diamond and many diamond manufacturers market ideal diamonds with differing facet patterns and angles as `` ideal cut '' .
10642,"In contrast to the AGSL , AGA , and EGL-USA the Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) has stated that there is not enough industry consensus or empirical data to specify cut grading standards for Princess cut diamonds and to do so is at the risk of consumers who may be deceived by diamonds accompanied by unqualified Ideal or Excellent cut grades ."
10643,"The name `` Princess Cut '' was originally used in connection with another diamond cut , otherwise known as the `` Profile '' cut , designed by Arpad Nagy , a London cutter , in 1961 ."
10644,"The same name was later used and made popular by Ygal Perlman , Betzalel Ambar , and Israel Itzkowitz in Israel in 1979 ."
10645,"A similar cut with only 49 facets , as opposed to the original 58 facets of the princess cut , was later branded the `` Quadrillion '' and initially distributed by Ambar Diamonds in Los Angeles ."
10646,Three years of optical research yielded a square stone with faceting similar to that of a round brilliant cut diamond .
10647,A Comparison
10648,The number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamond .
10649,This can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports .
10650,"By adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond , the individual facets of the diamond will now be broken down into smaller facets ."
10651,"As a result , it can give a princess cut diamond a `` crushed ice '' look ."
10652,"Vice versa , when a princess cut diamond has lesser chevrons , it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets ."
10653,"The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris ) is a subspecies of the gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) , a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora ."
10654,The term `` domestic dog '' is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties .
10655,"The dog has been the first animal to be domesticated and has been the most widely kept working , hunting , and pet animal in human history ."
10656,"The word `` dog '' may also mean the male of a canine species , as opposed to the word `` bitch '' for the female of the species ."
10657,"MtDNA evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog 's lineage and the modern wolf 's lineage around 100,000 years ago but , , the oldest fossil specimens genetically linked to the modern dog 's lineage date to approximately 33,000-36,000 years ago ."
10658,Dogs ' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures .
10659,"Dogs perform many roles for people , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship , and , more recently , aiding handicapped individuals ."
10660,This impact on human society has given them the nickname `` Man 's Best Friend '' in the Western world .
10661,"In some cultures , dogs are also a source of meat ."
10662,"In 2001 , there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world ."
10663,"Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old , having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles ."
10664,"Through this selective breeding , the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds , and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal ."
10665,"For example , height measured to the withers ranges from in the Chihuahua to about in the Irish Wolfhound ; color varies from white through grays ( usually called `` blue '' ) to black , and browns from light ( tan ) to dark ( `` red '' or `` chocolate '' ) in a wide variation of patterns ; coats can be short or long , coarse-haired to wool-like , straight , curly , or smooth ."
10666,It is common for most breeds to shed this coat .

10668,"A 1973 Siemens electron microscope , Musée des Arts et Métiers , Paris"
10669,An electron microscope ( EM ) is a type of microscope that uses an electron beam to illuminate a specimen and produce a magnified image .
10670,"An EM has greater resolving power than a light microscope and can reveal the structure of smaller objects because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than visible light photons ."
10671,"They can achieve better than 50 pm resolution and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas ordinary , non-confocal light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x ."
10672,The electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control the electron beam and focus it to form an image .
10673,These electron optical lenses are analogous to the glass lenses of a light optical microscope .
10674,"Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples , metals , and crystals ."
10675,"Industrially , the electron microscope is often used for quality control and failure analysis ."
10676,"Modern electron microscopes produce electron micrographs , using specialized digital cameras or frame grabbers to capture the image ."

10754,Three types of cell division
10755,Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells .
10756,Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle .
10757,"In eukaryotes , there are two distinct type of cell division : a vegetative division , whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ) , and a reductive cell division , whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half , to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ) ."
10758,"Both of these cell division cycles are required in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle , and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells ."
10759,"All cell divisions , regardless of organism , are preceded by a single round of DNA replication ."
10760,"For simple unicellular organisms such as the amoeba , one cell division is equivalent to reproduction – an entire new organism is created ."
10761,"On a larger scale , mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms , such as plants that grow from cuttings ."
10762,"Cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote , which itself was produced by cell division from gametes ."
10763,"And after growth , cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organism ."
10764,"A human being 's body experiences about 10,000 trillion cell divisions in a lifetime ."
10765,Cell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules .
10766,The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell 's genome .
10767,"Before division can occur , the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated , and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cells ."
10768,A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between `` generations '' .

10779,From 1989 the racing has been developed by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the Isle of Man TT Festival .
10780,The race is run in a time-trial format on public roads closed for racing by the provisions of an Act of Tynwald ( the parliament of the Isle of Man ) .
10781,The first race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy .
10782,"The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the St John 's Short Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal touring motorcycles with exhaust silencers , saddles , pedals and mud-guards ."
10783,"The winner of the single-cylinder class , and overall winner of the first event in 1907 , was Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle in a time of 4 hours , 8 minutes and 8 seconds at an average race speed of 38.21 mph ."
10784,The winner of the twin-cylinder class was Rem Fowler riding a Peugeot engined Norton in a time of 4 hours 21 minutes and 52 seconds at an average race speed of 36.21 mph .

10794,Unemployment ( or joblessness ) occurs when people are without work and actively seeking work .
10795,The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force .
10796,"During periods of recession , an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate ."
10797,"According to International Labour Organization report , more than 197 million people globally are out of work or 6 % of the world 's workforce were without a job in 2012 ."
10798,"There remains considerable theoretical debate regarding the causes , consequences and solutions for unemployment ."
10799,"Classical economics , New classical economics , and the Austrian School of economics argue that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment ."
10800,"These theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside , such as unionization , minimum wage laws , taxes , and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workers ."
10801,Keynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessions .
10802,This theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workers .
10803,"Keynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers ; these can include financial stimuli , publicly funded job creation , and expansionist monetary policies ."
10804,"In addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment , there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic system ."
10805,"The main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets , including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets ."
10806,Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization .
10807,Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals ' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a job .
10808,Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates .
10809,"Behavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making , and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages ."
10810,"Collectivism is any philosophic , political , religious , economic , or social outlook that emphasizes the interdependence of every human being in a society or civilization ."
10811,Collectivism is a basic cultural element that exists as the reverse of individualism in human nature ( in the same way high context culture exists as the reverse of low context culture ) .
10812,"Collectivist orientations stress the importance of cohesion within social groups ( such as an `` in-group '' , in what specific context it is defined ) and in some cases , the priority of group goals over individual goals ."
10813,"Collectivists often focus on community , society , nation or country ."
10814,"It has been used as an element in many different and diverse types of government and political , economic and educational philosophies throughout history and most human societies in practice contain elements of both individualism and collectivism ."
10815,Some examples of collectivist cultures include India and Japan .
10816,Collectivism can be divided into horizontal collectivism and vertical collectivism .
10817,"Horizontal collectivism stresses collective decision-making among equal individuals , and is thus usually based on decentralization and egalitarianism ."
10818,"Vertical collectivism is based on hierarchical structures of power and on moral and cultural conformity , and is therefore based on centralization and hierarchy ."
10819,"A cooperative enterprise would be an example of horizontal collectivism , whereas a military hierarchy would be an example of vertical collectivism ."
10820,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) is an immune mediated disease of the brain .
10821,"It usually occurs following a viral infection but may appear following vaccination , bacterial or parasitic infection , or even appear spontaneously ."
10822,"As it involves autoimmune demyelination , it is similar to multiple sclerosis , and is considered part of the Multiple sclerosis borderline diseases ."
10823,"The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year ."
10824,"Although it occurs in all ages , most reported cases are in children and adolescents , with the average age around 5 to 8 years old ."
10825,"The mortality rate may be as high as 5 % , full recovery is seen in 50 to 75 % of cases , while up to 70 to 90 % recover with some minor residual disability ."
10826,The average time to recover is one to six months .
10827,"ADEM produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord , particularly in the white matter ."
10828,"Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres , cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord , but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex , thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved ."
10829,"When the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode , it is called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis ( MDEM ) ."
10830,"The stomach is a muscular , hollow , dilated part of the digestion system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in some animals , including vertebrates , echinoderms , insects ( mid-gut ) , and molluscs ."
10831,"It is involved in the second phase of digestion , following mastication ( chewing ) ."
10832,The stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine .
10833,"It secretes protein-digesting enzymes called protease and strong acids to aid in food digestion , ( sent to it via esophageal peristalsis ) through smooth muscular contortions ( called segmentation ) before sending partially digested food ( chyme ) to the small intestines ."
10834,"The word stomach is derived from the Latin stomachus which is derived from the Greek word stomachos ( στόμαχος ) , ultimately from stoma ( ) , `` mouth '' ."
10835,The words gastro- and gastric ( meaning related to the stomach ) are both derived from the Greek word gaster ( ) .
10836,1940 Pontiac Special Series 25 Woodie
10837,"A woodie is a car body style , especially a station wagon , where the rear bodywork is constructed of wood framework with infill panels of wood or painted metal ."
10838,"After the demise of actual wood construction , manufacturers used simulated woodgrain sheet vinyl—sometimes augmented with three-dimensional , simulated framework—to recall wood construction ."
10839,"In 2008 , wood construction was evoked abstractly on the Ford Flex with a series of side and rear horizontal grooves ."
10840,A pearl is a hard object produced within the soft tissue ( specifically the mantle ) of a living shelled mollusc .
10841,"Just like the shell of a clam , a pearl is made up of calcium carbonate in minute crystalline form , which has been deposited in concentric layers ."
10842,"The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth , but many other shapes of pearls ( baroque pearls ) occur ."
10843,"The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries , and because of this , the word pearl has become a metaphor for something very rare , fine , admirable , and valuable ."
10844,"The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild , but they are extremely rare ."
10845,These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls .
10846,Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those that are currently sold .
10847,"Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry , but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor , and often , artificial pearls are easily distinguished from genuine pearls ."
10848,"Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry , but in the past they were also stitched onto lavish clothing ."
10849,"Pearls have also been crushed and used in cosmetics , medicines , and in paint formulations ."
10850,"Whether wild or cultured , gem quality pearls are almost always nacreous and , as is the interior of the shell that produces them ."
10851,"However , almost all species of shelled molluscs are capable of producing pearls ( formally referred to as `` calcareous concretions '' by some sources ) of lesser shine or less spherical shape ."
10852,"Although these may also be legitimately referred to as `` pearls '' by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules , and are formed in the same way , most of them have no value , except as curiosities ."

10861,A diagram showing an I Formation on offense and a 4-3 Formation on defense
10862,"In American football , each team has eleven players on the field at one time ."
10863,The specific role that a player takes on the field is called their position .
10864,"Under the modern rules of American football , teams are allowed unlimited subsititutions , that is teams may change any number of players after any play ."
10865,"This has resulted in the development of three `` platoons '' of players , the offense ( the team with the ball , who is trying to score ) , the defense ( the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring , and to take the ball from them ) , and the special teams ( who play in kicking situations ) ."
10866,"Within those platoons , various specific positions exist depending on what the player 's main job is ."

10869,"The Irish people 's earliest ancestors are recorded in legends – they are claimed to be descended from groups such as the Nemedians , Fomorians , Fir Bolg , Tuatha Dé Danann and the Milesians ."
10870,"Lebor Gabála Érenn , a book of Irish mythology tells that Milesians were Scythian descendants ."
10871,"The main groups that interacted with the Irish in the Middle Ages include the Picts , Scots , and the Vikings ."
10872,"Due to this contact , Icelanders are noted for having some Irish descent ."
10873,"The Anglo-Norman invasion of the High Middle Ages , the English plantations and the subsequent English rule of the country introduced the Normans and Flemish into Ireland ."
10874,"Welsh , Picts , Bretons , and small parties of Gauls and even Anglo-Saxons are known in Ireland from much earlier times ."

10888,"A aperture telescope in low Earth orbit , Hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared ."
10889,The telescope is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble .
10890,Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light .
10891,"Hubble 's Deep Field have been some of the most detailed visible-light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time ."
10892,"Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe ."
10893,"Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy ."
10894,"The HST was built by the United States space agency NASA , with contributions from the European Space Agency , and is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute ."
10895,"The HST is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope ."
10896,Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 .
10897,"Hubble was funded in the 1970s , with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the Challenger disaster ."
10898,"When finally launched in 1990 , scientists found that the main mirror had been ground incorrectly , compromising the telescope 's capabilities ."
10899,The telescope was restored to its intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993 .
10900,Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts .
10901,"Between 1993 and 2002 , four missions repaired , upgraded , and replaced systems on the telescope ; a fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster ."
10902,"However , after spirited public discussion , NASA administrator Mike Griffin approved one final servicing mission , completed in 2009 by Space Shuttle Atlantis ."

10915,SS Andrea Doria .
10916,"Pronounced was an ocean liner for the Italian Line ( Società di navigazione Italia ) home ported in Genoa , Italy , most famous for its sinking in 1956 , when 52 people died ( 51 from immediate impact ) ."
10917,"Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria , the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew ."
10918,"For a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after World War II , Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride ."
10919,"Of all Italy 's ships at the time , Andrea Doria was the largest , fastest and supposedly safest ."
10920,"Launched on 16 June 1951 , the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953 ."
10921,"On 25 July 1956 , while the Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket , Massachusetts , bound for New York City , the eastbound of the Swedish American Line collided with it in what became one of history 's most infamous maritime disasters ."
10922,"Struck in the side , the top-heavy Andrea Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard , which left half of its lifeboats unusable ."
10923,"The consequent shortage of lifeboats might have resulted in significant loss of life , but the efficiency of the ship 's technical design allowed it to stay afloat for over 11 hours after the ramming ."
10924,"The good behavior of the crew , improvements in communications and the rapid response of other ships averted a disaster similar in scale to that of the in 1912 ."
10925,"1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived , while 46 people died as a consequence of the collision ."
10926,The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning .
10927,This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of the in 1915 .
10928,The incident and its aftermath were heavily covered by the news media .
10929,"While the rescue efforts were both successful and commendable , the cause of the collision with the Stockholm and the loss of Andrea Doria generated much interest in the media and many lawsuits ."
10930,"Largely because of an out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies during hearings immediately after the disaster , no determination of the cause ( s ) was ever formally published ."
10931,"Although greater blame appeared initially to fall on the Italian liner , more recent discoveries have indicated that a misreading of radar on the Swedish ship may have initiated the collision course , leading to errors on both ships ."
10932,Andrea Doria was the last major transatlantic passenger vessel to sink before aircraft became the preferred method of travel .
10933,Dialysis tubing
10934,Dialysis tubing is a type of semi- or partially permeable membrane tubing made from regenerated cellulose or cellophane .
10935,It can be used for diffusion with solutes or osmosis if used with water only .
10936,Osmosis is when water passes through a semi-permeable layer to reach equilibrium .
10937,"Diffusion , on the other hand , allows the movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration ."
10938,It will only allow molecules to pass through a semi-permeable membrane or layer if the molecule is small enough to fit through the membrane or a membrane 's pore .
10939,"This usually results with the effects of diffusion through a membrane only really affects small molecules , and almost never larger molecules ."
10940,"Dialysis tubing is used in clinical circumstances to ensure a filtered flow of molecules , preventing the flow of larger solute molecules ."
10941,"Small molecules can be `` washed '' out of a solution which is pumped through the tubing into a solvent , usually water , which surrounds it and in which they can be flushed away ."
10942,"In demonstrations of semi-permeable membranes , a solution containing several types of molecules , usually glucose and starch , is placed into a semi-permeable dialysis bag , such as a cellulose membrane with pores , and the bag is sealed with a knot or elastic band ."
10943,"The sealed dialysis bag is placed in a container of a different solution , or water ."
10944,"Molecules small enough to pass through the tubing ( water , salts , monosaccharides , and other small molecules ) tend to move into or out of the dialysis bag in the direction of decreasing concentration , therefore displaying diffusion ."
10945,"Larger molecules ( such as proteins , or polysaccharides ) that have dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag ."
10946,"The water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic solution ( a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to ) will cross a semi-permeable membrane , like dialysis tubing , into a hypertonic solution ( a solution that has a higher solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to ) in an attempt to reach equilibrium , where the solute concentration of each solution is in equilibrium ."
10947,Mercury laboratory thermometer
10948,"A thermometer ( from the Greek , thermos , meaning `` hot '' and μἐτρον , metron , `` measure '' ) is a device that measures temperature or temperature gradient using a variety of different principles ."
10949,"A thermometer has two important elements : the temperature sensor ( e.g . the bulb on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ) in which some physical change occurs with temperature , plus some means of converting this physical change into a numerical value ( e.g . the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer ) ."
10950,"There are many types and many uses for thermometers , as detailed below in sections of this article ."
10951,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures .
10952,"Based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm , it is the first full-length cel animated feature film and the earliest in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series ."
10953,"The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank , Richard Creedon , Merrill De Maris , Otto Englander , Earl Hurd , Dick Rickard , Ted Sears and Webb Smith ."
10954,"David Hand was the supervising director , while William Cottrell , Wilfred Jackson , Larry Morey , Perce Pearce , and Ben Sharpsteen directed the film 's individual sequences ."
10955,"Snow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21 , 1937 , followed by a nationwide release on February 4 , 1938 , and with international earnings of $ 8 million during its initial release briefly assumed the record of highest grossing sound film at the time ."
10956,"The popularity of the film has led to it being re-released theatrically many times , until its home video release in the 1990s ."
10957,"Adjusted for inflation , it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office ."
10958,"At the 11th Academy Awards , Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar , and the film was nominated for Best Musical Score ."
10959,"It was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1989 and is ranked in the American Film Institute 's list of the 100 greatest American films , who also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008 ."
10960,"Disney 's take on the fairy tale has had a big cultural impact , resulting in a popular theme park attraction , a video game , and a Broadway musical ."
10961,"Childbirth , labour , delivery , birth , partus , or parturition is the culmination of a pregnancy period with the expulsion of one or more newborn infants from a woman 's uterus ."
10962,"The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour : the shortening and dilation of the cervix , descent and birth of the infant , and birth of the placenta ."
10963,"In many cases and with increasing frequency , childbirth is achieved through induction of labor or caesarean section , which is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen , rather than through vaginal birth ."
10964,"Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50 % in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006 , and comprise nearly 32 % of births in the U.S. and Canada ."
10965,"With respect to induced labor , more than 22 % of women undergo induction of labour in the United States ."
10966,"Medical professional policy makers find that induced births and elective cesarean can be harmful to the fetus and neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother , and have established strict guidelines for non-medically indicated induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks ."
10967,"Viva La Bam was an MTV & Viva show which followed Bam Margera and his crew as they undertook challenges , performed stunts and traveled the world ."
10968,The show ran for 5 seasons between 2003 and 2005 .

10974,The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta .
10975,The Braves are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball 's National League .
10976,The Braves have played in Turner Field since 1997 .
10977,"The `` Braves '' name , which was first used in 1912 , originates from a term for a Native American warrior ."
10978,"They are nicknamed `` the Bravos '' , and often referred to as `` America 's Team `` in reference to the team 's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007 , gaining a wide fanbase ."
10979,"From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball , winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period ( omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions ) ."
10980,"The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005 , and returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010 ."
10981,"The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s , winning the title in 1995 ."
10982,"Since their debut in the National League in 1876 , the franchise has won 16 divisional titles , 17 National League pennants , as well as three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves , in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves , and in 1995 in Atlanta ."
10983,The Braves are the only MLB franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities .
10984,"The club is one of the National League 's two remaining charter franchises ( the other being the Chicago Cubs ) and was founded in Boston , Massachusetts , in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings ( not to be confused with the American League 's Boston Red Sox ) ."
10985,They are considered `` the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports . ''
10986,"There is an argument as to who is actually older because although the Cubs are a full season `` older '' ( formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870 ) Chicago lost two seasons to the Great Chicago Fire , thus the Braves have played more consecutive seasons ."
10987,"After various name changes ( such as the Boston Beaneaters ) , the team operated as the Boston Braves for most of the first half of the 20th century ."
10988,"In 1953 , the team moved to Milwaukee , Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves , followed by the move to Atlanta in 1966 ."
10989,"The team 's tenure in Atlanta is famous for Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth 's career home run record in 1974 , though the majority of Aaron 's home runs were hit while the team was in Milwaukee ."
10990,"His record stood until 2007 , when San Francisco left fielder Barry Bonds broke the record ."
10991,The leaves of a Beech tree
10992,"3D rendering of a μCT scan of a leaf piece , resolution circa 40 μm/ voxel ."
10993,"A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant , as defined in botanical terms , and in particular in plant morphology ."
10994,Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature of plants .
10995,"Typically a leaf is a thin , flattened organ borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis , but many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms : some are not flat ( for example many succulent leaves and conifers ) , some are not above ground ( such as bulb scales ) , and some are without major photosynthetic function ( consider for example cataphylls , spines , and cotyledons ) ."
10996,"Conversely , many structures of non-vascular plants , or even of some lichens , which are not plants at all ( in the sense of being members of the kingdom Plantae ) , do look and function much like leaves ."
10997,"Furthermore , several structures found in vascular plants look like leaves but are not actually leaves ; they differ from leaves in their structures and origins ."
10998,"Examples include phyllodes , cladodes , and phylloclades ."
10999,Title card for the 1937 Our Gang comedy Rushin ' Ballet .
11000,Our Gang ( also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach 's Rascals ) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures .
11001,"Created by comedy producer Hal Roach , the series is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way , as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected , raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles ."
11002,"In addition , Our Gang notably put boys , girls , whites and blacks together in a group as equals , something that `` broke new ground , '' according to film historian Leonard Maltin ."
11003,Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since been repeated after the success of Our Gang .
11004,The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects .
11005,"When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) in 1927 , and converted the series to sound in 1929 , the series took off even further ."
11006,"Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938 , when the series was sold to MGM , who then continued producing the comedies until 1944 ."
11007,"The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film , General Spanky , featuring over forty-one child actors ."
11008,"As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights , the 80 Roach-produced `` talkies '' were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955 ."
11009,"Both Roach 's The Little Rascals package ( now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM 's Our Gang package ( now owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment ) have since remained in syndication , with periodic new productions based on the shorts surfacing over the years , including a 1994 Little Rascals feature film released by Universal Pictures ."
11010,"Zacharias Janssen ( also Zacharias Jansen or Sacharias Jansen ) ( b.1580-88 , d.pre-1632 to 1638 ) was a Dutch spectacle-maker from Middelburg associated with the invention of the first optical telescope ."
11011,Janssen is sometimes also credited for inventing the first truly compound microscope .

11037,Four Thirds logo
11038,The Four Thirds system is a standard created by Olympus and Kodak for digital single-lens reflex camera ( DSLR ) design and development. < ref name='DPReview.com 2001-02-13 ' >
11039,"The system provides a standard that , with digital cameras and lenses available from multiple manufacturers , allows for the interchange of lenses and bodies from different manufacturers ."
11040,seems to cover the standard .
11041,"Proponents describe it as an open standard , but companies may only use it under a non-disclosure agreement ."
11042,"Unlike older SLR systems , Four Thirds has been designed from the ground up to be entirely digital ."
11043,"Many lenses are extensively computerized , to the point that Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them ."
11044,"Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors , most notably through telecentric designs ."
11045,"The size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most DSLRs and this implies that lenses , especially telephoto lenses , can be smaller ."
11046,"For example , a Four Thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard , and is correspondingly more compact ."
11047,"Thus , the Four Thirds System has crop factor ( focal length multiplier ) of about 2 , and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification , it does n't aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses ."
11048,"The image sensor format , generally intermediate between those of larger SLRs and smaller compact cameras , generally gives levels of cost , performance and convenience intermediate between those two classes ."
11049,"HVAC systems use ventilation air ducts installed throughout a building to supply conditioned air to a room through outlet vents , called diffusers ; and ducts to remove air through return-air grilles ."
11050,"HVAC ( heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ) is the technology of indoor and automotive environmental comfort ."
11051,"HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering , based on the principles of thermodynamics , fluid mechanics , and heat transfer ."
11052,"Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field 's abbreviation as HVAC & R or HVACR , or ventilating is dropped as in HACR ( such as the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers ) ."
11053,"HVAC is important in the design of medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and in marine environments such as aquariums , where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity , using fresh air from outdoors ."
11054,"Ventilation on the downdraught system , by impulsion , or the 'plenum ' principle , applied to schoolrooms ( 1899 )"
11055,"Heating , ventilating , and air conditioning is based on inventions and discoveries made by Nikolay Lvov , Michael Faraday , Willis Carrier , Reuben Trane , James Joule , William Rankine , Sadi Carnot , and many others ."
11056,"The invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the industrial revolution , and new methods of modernization , higher efficiency , and system control are constantly introduced by companies and inventors worldwide ."
11057,"The three central functions of heating , ventilating , and air-conditioning are interrelated , especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation , operation , and maintenance costs ."
11058,"HVAC systems can provide ventilation , reduce air infiltration , and maintain pressure relationships between spaces ."
11059,The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as room air distribution .
11060,The starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions .
11061,"However before taking up the heat load calculation , it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail , as pressurization is an important consideration ."
11062,"In modern buildings the design , installation , and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems ."
11063,"For very small buildings , contractors normally capacity engineer and select HVAC systems and equipment ."
11064,"For larger buildings , building services designers and engineers , such as mechanical , architectural , or building services engineers analyze , design , and specify the HVAC systems , and specialty mechanical contractors fabricate and commission them ."
11065,Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of buildings .
11066,"The HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise , with roles including operation and maintenance , system design and construction , equipment manufacturing and sales , and in education and research ."
11067,"The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment , but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI , ASHRAE , SMACNA , ACCA , Uniform Mechanical Code , International Mechanical Code , and AMCA have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement ."

11071,"The Bond character is a Secret Service agent , code number 007 , residing in London but active internationally ."
11072,"Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II , to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes ; Bond 's name was appropriated from American ornithologist James Bond ."
11073,"Bond has a number of character traits which run throughout the books , including an enjoyment of cars , a love of food and drink , and an average intake of sixty custom-made cigarettes a day ."
11074,"Since Fleming 's death in 1964 , there have been other authorised writers of Bond material , including John Gardner , who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations and Raymond Benson , who wrote six novels , three novelizations and three short stories ."
11075,"There have also been three authors who wrote one book each , Kingsley Amis ( writing as Robert Markham ) , Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver ."
11076,Additionally a series of novels based on Bond 's youth— Young Bond —was written by Charlie Higson .
11077,"As spin-offs from the literary works , there was a television adaptation of the first novel , Casino Royale , in which Bond was played as an American agent ."
11078,A comic strip series also ran in the Daily Express newspaper .
11079,There have also been twenty-five Bond films ; seven actors have played Bond in these films .

11087,"The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish , and the largest by land area is Cameron Parish ."
11088,"Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp ."
11089,These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets .
11090,"There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish ."
11091,"In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape , and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas ."
11092,"These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants ."
11093,"Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural , multilingual heritage , being so strongly influenced by an admixture of 18th-century French , Spanish , Native American ( Indian ) and African cultures that they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U.S ."
11094,"Before the American purchase of the territory , the current Louisiana State had been both a Spanish and French colony ."
11095,"In addition , the pattern of development included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century , with many from the same region of West Africa , thus concentrating their culture ."
11096,"In the post-Civil War environment , Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization , and in 1915 , English was made the only official language of the state ."
11097,"The laws of science or scientific laws are statements that describe , predict , and perhaps explain why , a range of phenomena behave as they appear to in nature ."
11098,"The term `` law '' has diverse usage in many cases : approximate , accurate , broad or narrow theories , in all natural scientific disciplines ( physics , chemistry , biology , geology , astronomy etc . ) ."
11099,An analogous term for a scientific law is a principle .
11100,Scientific laws:
11101,"summarize a large collection of facts determined by experiment into a single statement,"
11102,"can usually be formulated mathematically as one or several statements or equation , or at least stated in a single sentence , so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment , given the initial , boundary , and other physical conditions of the processes which take place,"
11103,are strongly supported by empirical evidence - they are scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified ( and never falsified ) .
11104,"Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out , but rather the scope of application , since the equation ( if any ) representing the law does not change ."
11105,"As with other scientific knowledge , they do not have absolute certainty like mathematical theorems or identities , and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations ."
11106,are often quoted as a fundamental controlling influence rather than a description of observed facts .
11107,I.e . `` the laws of motion require that ''
11108,"Laws differ from hypotheses and postulates , which are proposed during the scientific process before and during validation by experiment and observation ."

11331,"She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women , black and white , were denied those same rights ."
11332,"Her position on this issue , together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women 's issues beyond voting rights , led to the formation of two separate women 's rights organizations that were finally rejoined , with Stanton as president of the joint organization , approximately twenty years after her break from the original women 's suffrage movement ."
11333,"Stanton died in 1902 having authored both The Woman 's Bible and her autobiography , along with many articles and pamphlets concerning female suffrage and women 's rights ."

11356,The 19.9 MW Gemasolar solar plant in Spain features 15 hours of storage and can supply power 24 hours a day .
11357,"Solar energy , radiant light and heat from the sun , has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies ."
11358,"Solar energy technologies include solar heating , solar photovoltaics , solar thermal electricity , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis , which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent energy problems the world now faces ."
11359,"Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute solar energy ."
11360,Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy .
11361,"Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air ."
11362,"In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that `` the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits ."
11363,"It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating climate change , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise ."
11364,These advantages are global .
11365,Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared '' .
11366,"The classical Latin alphabet or Roman alphabet evolved from a western variety of the Greek alphabet called the Cumaean alphabet , which was adopted and modified by the Etruscans who ruled early Rome ."
11367,The Etruscan alphabet was in turn adopted and further modified by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language .
11368,"During the Middle Ages , the Latin alphabet was adapted to Romance languages , direct descendants of Latin , as well as to Celtic , Germanic , Baltic , and some Slavic languages ."
11369,"With the age of colonialism and Christian evangelism , the Latin script was spread overseas , and applied to indigenous American , Australian , Austronesian , Austroasiatic , and African languages ."
11370,"More recently , linguists have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the International Phonetic Alphabet ( itself largely based on Latin script ) when transcribing or creating written standards for non-European languages , such as the African reference alphabet ."
11371,"The term Latin alphabet may refer to either the alphabet used to write Latin ( as described in this article ) , or other alphabets based on the Latin script , which is the basic set of letters common to the various alphabets descended from the classical Latin one , such as the English alphabet ."
11372,"These Latin-derived alphabets may discard letters , like the Rotokas alphabet , or add new letters , like the Danish and Norwegian alphabet ."
11373,"Letter shapes have changed over the centuries , including the creation for Medieval Latin of lower case forms which did not exist in the Classical period ."

11397,Club Levels allow fans multiple levels of entertainment .
11398,"Club Level seating is open to the elements , as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes , which gives more of an outdoors impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas ."
11399,Club Level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the stadium .
11400,The Club Level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the arena exclusive to fans with special tickets .

11434,"The aqueduct , constructed in AD 80 , carried water some from the hilly Eifel region of what is now Germany to the ancient city of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ( present-day Cologne ) ."
11435,"If the auxiliary spurs to additional springs are included , the length was ."
11436,"The construction was almost entirely below ground , and the flow of the water was produced entirely by gravity ."
11437,"A few bridges , including one up to in length , were needed to pass over valleys ."

11448,"Religious affiliations of UK citizens are recorded by regular surveys , the four major ones being the UK Census , the Labour Force Survey , the British Social Attitudes survey and the European Social Survey ."
11449,"According to the 2001 UK census , Christianity is the major religion , followed by Islam , Hinduism , Sikhism , Judaism and Buddhism in terms of number of adherents ."
11450,"This , and the relatively large number of individuals with nominal or no religious affiliations has led commentators to variously describe the United Kingdom as a multi-faith , secularised , or post-Christian society ."
11451,"The United Kingdom was formed by the union of previously independent countries from 1707 , and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures ."
11452,"While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom , others may have a single structure covering England and Wales or Great Britain ."

11457,"Typically , a student 's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons , a number derived from the four years of academic classes that are normally required to obtain a bachelor 's degree at an American college or university ."
11458,"However , a student athlete may be offered the opportunity to redshirt for up to two years , which allows the athlete to spread those four years of eligibility over five , or sometimes six years ."
11459,"In a redshirt year , a student athlete may attend classes at the college or university , practice with an athletic team , and dress for play but he or she may not compete during the game ."
11460,"Using this mechanism , a student athlete has up to five academic years to use the four years of eligibility , thus becoming a fifth-year senior ."
11461,"The term is used as a verb , noun , and adjective ."

11464,"Map of countries that declared themselves to be socialist states under the Marxist–Leninist or Maoist definition - that is to say , `` Communist states '' - between 1979 and 1983 ."
11465,This period marked the greatest territorial extent of Communist states .
11466,A communist state is a state where the means of production are collectively owned by the society .
11467,It has a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party ( referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents ) and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist–Leninist ideology as the guiding principle of the state .
11468,"Technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless ."
11469,"From this perspective , the term Marxist-Leninist state is more appropriate ."
11470,"Historically , a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today , a communist state can also , for instance , refer to contemporary China and Vietnam , where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy ."
11471,"According to Marxist–Leninists , the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class , which in a socialist society is the working class , so a socialist state is , according to Leninists , a state of the working class ."
11472,"In practice , communist states do not actually refer to themselves as such ."
11473,"They do this not to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist , but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at present ."
11474,"Instead , they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers ' states ."
11475,"The primary goal of these states , which also explains their official name , is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism , ultimately leading to communism ."
11476,"Communist states may have several legal political parties , but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government , often by statute or under the constitution ."
11477,"Consequently , the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined , such as in the development of parallel institutions ."
11478,"In the 20th century , most communist states adopted planned economies ."
11479,"However , there were exceptions : The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management , while China , Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s ."
11480,"In the 21st century , China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop ."
11481,The fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop .
11482,"As a result , many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states ."
11483,"For example , dissenting communists such as Trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century , claiming either that they had nothing to do with `` real '' communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption ."

11502,Slug is a common name for an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusk .
11503,"The word `` slug '' is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell , has a very reduced shell , or has only a small internal shell ."
11504,"( This is in contrast to the common name `` snail `` , which is applied to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is large enough that the soft parts of the animal can retract fully into it . )"
11505,"Slugs exist on land and in the sea , and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs , Acochlidium ."
11506,"The unadorned word `` slug '' is however applied primarily to land slugs , whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as `` sea slugs `` and `` freshwater slugs '' ."
11507,"Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial , but is too small to retract into ( like many in the family Urocyclidae ) , are known as semislugs ."
11508,The various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages which also include snails .
11509,"Thus , for example , the various families of land slugs are not very closely related to one another , despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form ."
11510,"The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past , and thus the category `` slug '' is emphatically a polyphyletic one ."
11511,"Slugs , like all other gastropods , undergo torsion ( a 180° twisting of the internal organs ) during development ."
11512,"Internally , slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation , but externally the bodies of land slugs appear to be more or less symmetrical , except for the positioning of the pneumostome , which is on one side of the animal , normally the right hand side ."
11513,"The soft , slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation , so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry ."
11514,The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs .
11515,Imperial Standard of Napoleon I
11516,"Napoleon Bonaparte ( , ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821 ) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe ."
11517,"As Napoleon I , he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815 ."
11518,"His legal reform , the Napoleonic Code , has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide , but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions , the so-called Napoleonic Wars ."
11519,"He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution , while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed Ancien Régime ."
11520,"Due to his success in these wars , often against numerically superior enemies , he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time , and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide ."
11521,Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry which had settled Corsica in the 16th century .
11522,He trained as an artillery officer in mainland France .

11524,He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula .
11525,"In 1799 , he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor , following a plebiscite in his favour ."
11526,"In the first decade of the 19th century , the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power ."
11527,"After a streak of victories , France secured a dominant position in continental Europe , and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states ."

11559,"Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade ."
11560,"Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it ."
11561,"Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry ."

11575,"However , there exists no formal criteria for when educational programs and scholarly journals form an academic discipline ."
11576,"A huge difference exists between , on the one hand , well established disciplines that exist in almost all universities all over the world , have a long history , and have a well established set of journals and conferences , and , on the other hand , suggestions for new fields supported only by few universities and publications ."
11577,"Fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches , and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous ."
11578,PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language .

11598,The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin .
11599,"However , the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations ( HSCA ) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy ."
11600,"However , ABC News in their investigation , The Kennedy Assassination : Beyond Conspiracy , confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission ; having concluded Oswald acted alone ."
11601,Kennedy 's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970 .

11609,"A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes a subject by asserting that it is , on some point of comparison , the same as another otherwise unrelated object ."
11610,"Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association , comparison or resemblance including allegory , hyperbole , and simile ."
11611,"In simpler terms , a metaphor compares two objects or things without using the words `` like '' or `` as '' ."
11612,One of the most prominent examples of a metaphor in English literature is the All the world 's a stage monologue from As You Like It :
11613,"All the world 's a stage,"
11614,And all the men and women merely players ;
11615,"They have their exits and their entrances ; — William Shakespeare , As You Like It , 2/7"
11616,This quote is a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage .
11617,"By figuratively asserting that the world is a stage , Shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the lives of the people within it ."

11622,"Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing , normally on paper ."
11623,"Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints with an element of originality , rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting ."
11624,"Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece , which is called a print ."
11625,Each print produced is not considered a `` copy '' but rather is considered an `` original '' .
11626,"This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process , and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique ."
11627,A print may be known as an impression .
11628,"Printmaking ( other than monotyping ) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions , but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to ."
11629,Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material .
11630,"Common types of matrices include : metal plates , usually copper or zinc , or polymer plates for engraving or etching ; stone , aluminum , or polymer for lithography ; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts ."
11631,Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screenprinting process .
11632,Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below .
11633,Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition .

11652,"That afternoon , in accordance with Hitler 's prior instructions , their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker 's emergency exit , doused in petrol and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker ."
11653,"The Soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed , cremated and the ashes scattered ."
11654,"Accounts differ as to the cause of death ; one that he died by poison only and another that he died by a self-inflicted gunshot , while biting down on a cyanide capsule ."
11655,Contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions .
11656,"One eye-witness recorded that the body showed signs of having been shot through the mouth , but this has been proven unlikely ."
11657,There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments which were recovered .

11668,Such infections are more likely to occur in people with compromised immune systems .
11669,"Historically , Group A streptococcus made up most cases of Type II infections ."
11670,"However , since as early as 2001 , another serious form of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis has been observed with increasing frequency , caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) ."
11671,"Some published case reports have implied a possible link between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NF , though the evidence of the link was said to be weak because of a small number of case patients and it was unclear whether the drugs just masked the symptoms of a secondary infection or were a cause per se ."
11672,"World War II ( WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 ."

11771,Penis ( plural penises or penes ) is a general term for the organs with which male and hermaphrodite animals introduce sperm into receptive females during copulation .
11772,"Such organs occur in many animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , but males do not bear a penis in every animal species , and in those species in which the male does bear a so-called penis , the penes in the various species are not necessarily homologous ."
11773,"For example , the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle ."
11774,"The term penis applies to many reproductive intromittent organs , but not to all ; for example the intromittent organ of most cephalopoda is the hectocotylus , a specialised arm , and male spiders use their pedipalps ."
11775,"In most species of animals in which there is an organ that might reasonably be described as a penis , it has no major function other than intromission , or at least conveying the sperm to the female , but in the placental mammals the penis bears the distal part of the urethra , which discharges both urine during urination and semen during copulation as the occasion requires ."

11824,Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53 .
11825,"The name is from Greek ioeidēs , meaning violet or purple , due to the color of elemental iodine vapor ."
11826,"Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition , and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers ."
11827,"Iodine 's relatively high atomic number , low toxicity , and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine ."
11828,Iodine has only one stable isotope .
11829,A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications .
11830,"Iodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion , I− , which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools ."
11831,"Like the other halogens , free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2 , and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen ."
11832,"In the universe and on Earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element ."
11833,"However , its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology ."
11834,"It is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions ( only tungsten , employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria , is heavier ) ."
11835,"Iodine 's rarity in many soils , due to initial low abundance as a crust-element , and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater , has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations ."
11836,Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities .
11837,"Iodine is required by higher animals , which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones , which contain the element ."
11838,"Because of this function , radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine ."
11839,"If inhaled , the radioisotope iodine-131 , which has a high fission product yield , concentrates in the thyroid , but is easily remedied with potassium iodide treatment ."
11840,"Lobbying ( also lobby ) is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government , most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies ."
11841,"Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups , including individuals in the private sector , corporations , fellow legislators or government officials , or advocacy groups ( interest groups ) ."
11842,"Lobbyists may be among a legislator 's constituencies , meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district , or not ; they may engage in lobbying as a business , or not ."
11843,Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them .
11844,"Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job ( for instance , a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to his/her company , or an activist meeting with his/her legislator in an unpaid capacity ) ."
11845,Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential .
11846,The ethics and morality of lobbying are .
11847,"Lobbying is often spoken of with contempt , when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law ( twisting it away from fairness ) in order to serve their own conflict of interest ."
11848,"But another side of lobbying is making sure that others ' interests are duly defended against others ' corruption , or even simply making sure that minority interests are fairly defended against mere tyranny of the majority ."
11849,"For example , a medical association , or a trade association of health insurance companies , may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies , in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified ( duly defending against others ' corruption ) ."
11850,The difficulty in drawing objective lines between which lobbyists are `` good lobbyists '' and which ones are `` bad ones '' is compounded by the cleverness with which lobbyists or their clients can argue that their own lobbying is of the `` good '' kind .
11851,"At heart , the effort to influence legislation is a power struggle ."
11852,"As in other forms of power struggle , such as war or law enforcement , motives range from to self-defense to fighting for justice , and the dividing line between predation and justice is subject to rationalization ."

11879,"Some groups viewed by non-adherents as denominational actively resist being called a denomination and do not have any formal denominational structure , authority , or record-keeping beyond the local congregation ; several groups within Restoration Movement fall into this category ."
11880,"Some groups are large ( e.g . Catholics , Lutherans , Anglicans or Baptists ) , while others are just a few small churches , and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list ."
11881,"Modern movements such as Fundamentalist Christianity , Pietism , Evangelicalism , Pentecostalism and the Holiness movement sometimes cross denominational lines , or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups , ( as is the case for many United and uniting churches , for example ) ."

11883,Major divisions within Christianity .
11884,"Note : This is not a complete list , but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity ."
11885,"As there are reported to be approximately 41,000 Christian denominations , many of which can not be verified to be significant , only those denominations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable ."
11886,"Between denominations , theologians , and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian , disagreements arising primarily from doctrinal differences between groups ."
11887,"For the purpose of simplicity , this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination ."
11888,Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles .
11889,"There is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies , and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies ."
11890,"Often there is considerable disagreement between various churches about whether other churches should be labeled with pejorative terms such as `` cult '' , or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability ."
11891,"Such considerations often vary from place to place , where one religious group may enjoy majority status in one region , but be widely regarded as a `` dangerous cult '' in another part of the world ."

11899,"Under Napoleon Bonaparte , France took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in North America ."
11900,"A slave revolt in Haiti and an impending war with Britain , however , led France to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the United States , who had originally intended only to seek the purchase of New Orleans and its adjacent lands ."
11901,The purchase of the territory of Louisiana took place during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson .
11902,"At the time , the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional ."
11903,"Although he agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory , Jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove France 's presence in the region and to protect both U.S. trade access to the port of New Orleans and free passage on the Mississippi River ."

11906,"Released in 1966 , it reached No . 2 on the American R & B chart and No . 7 on the pop chart ."
11907,The backing track for this song was actually recorded ( secretly ) by the Motown house band The Funk Brothers .
11908,"Per one of the Funk Brothers , the song was originally to be called `` Pimp Jerk . ''"
11909,"This was taken from watching neighborhood pimps , who would dance in the clubs , but were too `` cool '' to do the jerk like regular folks ."
11910,Their version was subsequently named `` the Pimp Jerk . ''
11911,"The producer was afraid that a song with the word pimp in the title would be banned or not receive much positive attention , and had the title changed to its current form ."
11912,"The Go-Go 's , Todd Rundgren , Big Trouble , Human Sexual Response , The La De Da 's , The Creation , and The Coasters have covered the song ."
11913,"Todd Rundgren did his version in an odd time signature ( 7/4 ) , giving an obviously jerky feel to the song ."

11921,"A league is a unit of length ( or , rarely , area ) ."
11922,"It was long common in Europe and Latin America , but it is no longer an official unit in any nation ."
11923,The league originally referred to the distance a person could walk in an hour .
11924,"Since the Middle Ages , many values have been specified in several countries ."
11925,"In the context of nautical distances , the 3 mile ( 4.8 km ) distance corresponds to how far an observer of average height ( 5'9 '' or 1.78 m ) can see when standing at sea level ."
11926,"Thus , a ship traveling one `` league '' has reached what was previously the farthest visible distance on the horizon ."
11927,"The lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a `` league '' can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer ( i.e. , sightings from a ship 's deck vs. masthead ) ."
11928,"The Irish state came into being in 1922 as the Irish Free State , a dominion of the British Commonwealth , having seceded from the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Treaty ."
11929,It comprises 26 of Ireland 's 32 counties .
11930,Since 1949 it has existed as the Republic of Ireland .
11931,"From its foundation , the Irish Free State was embroiled in a civil war between nationalists supporting the Treaty and opponents who supported a republic ."
11932,"The pro-Treaty side , organised as Cumann na nGaedheal emerged victorious from the conflict and won subsequent elections ."
11933,"They formed the government of the state until 1932 , when they peacefully handed over power to the anti-Treaty faction in Fianna Fáil , who defeated them in an election ."
11934,"The Irish state , despite its violent beginnings , has remained a liberal democracy throughout its existence ."
11935,A new constitution in 1937 removed many of the links with Britain established under the Treaty and Ireland 's neutrality in the Second World War demonstrated its independence in foreign policy matters from Britain .
11936,In 1948 Ireland formally left the British Commonwealth and adopted the title of `` Republic '' .
11937,"In the economic sphere , the Irish state has had a mixed performance ."
11938,"On independence , it was one of the wealthier countries in Europe per head of population ."
11939,"However it also inherited from British rule the problems of unemployment , emigration , uneven geographical development and lack of a native industrial base ."
11940,"For much of its history , the state struggled to rectify these problems ."
11941,"Particular peaks of emigration were recorded during the late 1930s , 1950s and 1980s , when the Irish economy recorded little growth ."
11942,"In the 1930s , Fianna Fáil governments attempted to create Irish domestic industries using subsidies and protective tarifs ."
11943,"In the late 1950s , these policies were dropped in favour of free trade with selected countries and encouraging of foreign investment with low taxes ."
11944,This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1972 .
11945,"In the 1990s and 2000s , Ireland experienced an economic boom known as the Celtic Tiger , in which the country 's GDP surpassed many of its European neighbours ."
11946,"Immigration also surpassed emigration , bringing the state 's population up to over 4 million ."
11947,"However , since 2008 , Ireland has experienced a severe crisis in the banking sector and with sovereign debt ."
11948,The resultant economic slump has deepened the effect of the world recession on Ireland .
11949,"From 1937 to 1998 , the Irish constitution included a claim on Northern Ireland as a part of the national territory ."
11950,"However , the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups - principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army , who tried to unite Ireland by force ."
11951,"This occurred in the 1950s , throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale ."
11952,Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as The Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s .
11953,The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 .

12006,"In the early 20th century the term was often used , in a taxonomic sense , to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype ."
12007,"While biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits , others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way , i.e . that among humans , race has no taxonomic significance : all living humans belong to the same species , Homo sapiens and subspecies , Homo sapiens sapiens ."
12008,"Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time , involving folk taxonomies"
12009,that define of individuals based on perceived traits .
12010,"Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete , and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits ."
12011,Since the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic .

12026,"In finance , a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders ."
12027,"It is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and , depending on the terms of the bond , is obliged to pay them interest ( the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later date , termed the maturity ."
12028,"Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals ( semiannual , annual , sometimes monthly ) ."
12029,"Very often the bond is negotiable , i.e . the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market ."
12030,"Thus a bond is a form of loan or IOU : the holder of the bond is the lender ( creditor ) , the issuer of the bond is the borrower ( debtor ) , and the coupon is the interest ."
12031,"Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments , or , in the case of government bonds , to finance current expenditure ."
12032,Certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or short term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds : the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument .
12033,"Bonds and stocks are both securities , but the major difference between the two is that ( capital ) stockholders have an equity stake in the company ( i.e . they are owners ) , whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company ( i.e . they are lenders ) ."
12034,"Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term , or maturity , after which the bond is redeemed , whereas stocks may be outstanding indefinitely ."
12035,"An exception is an irredeemable bond , such as Consols , which is a perpetuity , i.e . a bond with no maturity ."

12051,"Old Sparky , the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison"
12052,"Execution by electrocution , usually performed using an electric chair , is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body ."
12053,"This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and , for a period of several decades , in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976 ) ."
12054,"Historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ) ."
12055,The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs .
12056,Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .
12057,"Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution ."
12058,"Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner ."
12059,"As of 2010 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia ."
12060,They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method .
12061,"In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 ( Kentucky : March 31 , 1998 ; Tennessee : December 31 , 1998 ) and who chose electrocution ."
12062,"In both states , inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection ."
12063,The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution .
12064,"It is the sole method of execution in Vermont , where treason is the only capital crime ."
12065,"On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution ."
12066,"This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder ."

12075,This battle marked the liberation of Paris and the exile of the Vichy government to Sigmaringen in Germany .
12076,"However , there was still much heavy fighting to be done before France was liberated , including the campaign in southern France during August-September ( in Provence and extending into the southwestern region of the Vosges Mountains ) , along the German-held seaports of western France ( such as at Brest and Dunkirk ) , in Alsace and Lorraine in eastern France , and in northeastern France , such as along the Rhine and Moder Rivers ."

12098,The New Deal was a series of economic programs enacted in the United States between 1933 and 1936 .
12099,They involved presidential executive orders or laws passed by Congress during the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
12100,"The programs were in response to the Great Depression , and focused on what historians call the `` 3 Rs '' : Relief , Recovery , and Reform ."
12101,That is Relief for the unemployed and poor ; Recovery of the economy to normal levels ; and Reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression .
12102,"The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of nine Presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) , with its base in liberal ideas , the white South , traditional Democrats , big city machines , and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities ."
12103,"The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an enemy of business and growth , and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient ."
12104,"The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s , while the opposition Conservative Coalition largely controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963 ."
12105,"By 1936 the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the New Deal , and `` conservative `` for its opponents ."
12106,"From 1934 to 1938 , Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavours by a “pro-spender” majority in Congress ( drawn from two-party , competitive , non-machine , Progressive , and Left party districts ) ."
12107,"As noted by Alexander Hicks , “Roosevelt , backed by rare , non-Southern Democrat majorities — 270 non-Southern Democrat representatives and 71 non-Southern Democrat senators — spelled Second New Deal reform.”"
12108,"Many historians distinguish between a `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) and a `` Second New Deal '' ( 1935–38 ) , with the second one more liberal and more controversial ."
12109,"The `` First New Deal '' ( 1933–34 ) dealt with diverse groups , from banking and railroads to industry and farming , all of which demanded help for economic survival ."
12110,"The Federal Emergency Relief Administration , for instance , provided $ 500 million for relief operations by states and cities , while the short-lived CWA ( Civil Works Administration ) gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34 ."
12111,"The `` Second New Deal `` in 1935–38 included the Wagner Act to promote labor unions , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) relief program ( which made the federal government by far the largest single employer in the nation ) , the Social Security Act , and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers ."
12112,"The final major items of New Deal legislation were the creation of the United States Housing Authority and Farm Security Administration , both in 1937 , and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 , which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most categories of workers ."
12113,"The economic downturn of 1937–38 , and the bitter split between the AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938 ."
12114,Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition .
12115,By 1942–43 they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and CCC and blocked major liberal proposals .
12116,"Roosevelt himself turned his attention to the war effort , and won reelection in 1940 and 1944 ."
12117,"The Supreme Court declared the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment Act ( AAA ) unconstitutional , however the AAA was rewritten and then upheld ."
12118,"As the first Republican president elected after FDR , Dwight D. Eisenhower ( 1953–61 ) left the New Deal largely intact , even expanding it in some areas ."
12119,"In the 1960s , Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs , which Republican Richard M. Nixon generally retained ."
12120,"After 1974 , however , the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support ."
12121,The New Deal regulation of banking ( Glass–Steagall Act ) was suspended in the 1990s .
12122,"Many New Deal programs remain active , with some still operating under the original names , including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ( FCIC ) , the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) , and the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) ."
12123,The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .

12133,"Although not used by the majority of the world 's countries , daylight saving time is common in the Western world ."
12134,Daylight saving time ( DST ) —also summer time in British English — is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less .
12135,Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn .
12136,The modern idea of daylight saving was first proposed in 1895 by George Vernon Hudson and it was first implemented during the First World War .
12137,Many countries have used it at various times since then .
12138,"Much of the United States used DST in the 1950s and 1960s , and DST use expanded following the 1970s energy crisis and has been widely used in North America and Europe since then ."
12139,The practice has been both praised and criticized .
12140,"Adding daylight to evenings benefits retailing , sports , and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours , but can cause problems for evening entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun ."
12141,"Although an early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting ( formerly a primary use of electricity ) , modern heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly , and research about how DST currently affects energy use is limited or contradictory ."
12142,DST clock shifts present other challenges .
12143,"They complicate timekeeping , and can disrupt meetings , travel , billing , record keeping , medical devices , heavy equipment , and sleep patterns ."
12144,"Software can often adjust computer clocks automatically , but this can be limited and error-prone , particularly when DST dates are changed ."

12149,"It is near a large forest , and contains light industry and farming , including saffron ."
12150,"Due to its numerous canals and bridges , Montargis sometimes bills itself as the `` Venice of the Gâtinais . ''"
12151,"Though quite modern , it retains a medieval charm in its downtown area ."
12152,"In computer storage , a logical unit number , or LUN , is a number used to identify a logical unit , which is a device addressed by the SCSI protocol or protocols which encapsulate SCSI , such as Fibre Channel or iSCSI ."
12153,"A LUN may be used with any device which supports read/write operations , such as a tape drive , but is most often used to refer to a logical disk as created on a SAN ."
12154,"Though not technically correct , the term `` LUN '' is often also used to refer to the logical disk itself ."
12155,"The Gospel According to Mark ( , , to euangelion kata Markon ) , commonly shortened to the Gospel of Mark or simply Mark , is the second book of the New Testament ."
12156,This canonical account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth is one of the three synoptic gospels .
12157,"It was thought to be an epitome , which accounts for its place as the second gospel in the Bible ."
12158,"However , most contemporary scholars now regard it as the earliest of the canonical gospels ( c 70 ) ."
12159,"That Mark was used as a source for the other synoptic gospels Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke is widely held by many , although not all , New Testament scholars ."
12160,The Gospel of Mark narrates the Ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death and resurrection .
12161,It focuses particularly on the last week of his life ( chapters 11–16 ) in Jerusalem .
12162,"Its swift narrative portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action , an exorcist , healer and miracle worker ."
12163,An important theme of Mark is the Messianic Secret .
12164,"Jesus silences the demoniacs he heals , tries unsuccessfully to keep his messianic identity secret , and conceals his message with parables ."
12165,"Meanwhile , the disciples fail to understand both the implication of the miracles of Jesus and the meaning of the things he predicts about his arrest , death and resurrection ."
12166,Most scholars believe that the original text of the gospel ends at Mark 16:8 with the discovery of Jesus ' empty tomb and that the following account of his resurrection appearances is a later addition .
12167,"According to tradition and some early church writers , the author is Mark the Evangelist , the companion of the apostle Peter ."
12168,"The gospel , however , appears to rely on several underlying sources , varying in form and in theology , which tells against the tradition that the gospel was based on Peter 's preaching ."
12169,"The text is a compilation which may include eye-witness accounts as well as known apostolic preachings , and pre-existing written records that do not exist today but can be confirmed from 2nd-century commentators ."
12170,Some of the stories in the gospel may have been transmitted orally before being written down .
12171,Various elements within the gospel suggest that the author wrote in Syria or Palestine for a non-Jewish Christian community .
12172,The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien .
12173,"The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 children 's fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work ."
12174,"It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , much of it during World War II ."
12175,"It is the second best-selling novel ever written , with over 150 million copies sold ."
12176,"The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth ."
12177,"From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a Hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across north-west Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , notably the hobbits Frodo Baggins , Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee , Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck and Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took , but also the hobbits ' chief allies and travelling companions : Aragorn , a Human Ranger ; Boromir , a man from Gondor ; Gimli , a Dwarf warrior ; Legolas , an Elven prince ; and Gandalf , a Wizard ."
12178,"The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , with the other being The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher ."
12179,"It was decided for economic reasons to publish The Lord of the Rings as three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 , thus creating the now familiar Lord of the Rings trilogy ."
12180,"The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King ."
12181,"Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume ."
12182,The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages .
12183,Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .
12184,"Although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia ."
12185,"Influences on this earlier work , and on the story of The Lord of the Rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien 's experiences in World War I ."
12186,The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of Tolkien 's works is such that the use of the words `` Tolkienian '' and `` Tolkienesque '' have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary .
12187,"The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works ."
12188,"The Lord of the Rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature ."
12189,"Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio , theatre , and film ."
12190,The following is an episode list for the Nickelodeon sitcom Drake & Josh .
12191,"The series debuted on January 11 , 2004 ."
12192,"A TV film Merry Christmas , Drake & Josh was made apart from the regular series on December 5 , 2008 ."
12193,There are a total of 60 episodes were produced spanning four seasons .
12194,"Drake Bell , Josh Peck , and Miranda Cosgrove were the only actors to appear in all 60 episodes ."
12195,"The San Francisco 49ers conduct training camp at the team 's headquarters and practice facility in Santa Clara , California in August 2010 ."
12196,"The offense is wearing red jerseys with the exception of quarterback Alex Smith , who is in a black jersey ; the defense in white ."
12197,"In the National Football League , training camp refers to the time before the season commences ."
12198,"During this time , teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location , usually a university , to conduct training camp for at least the first few weeks ."
12199,This is similar to baseball 's spring training .
12200,Training camp is used in several different ways .
12201,New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems .
12202,"For younger players , it serves as a period of evaluation ; for veterans , it is time to round back into form ."
12203,Training camp is divided into several different components .
12204,The first is scrimmages .
12205,These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games ' worth of plays .
12206,"Sometimes , two practice sessions are held on the same day ."
12207,This concept is referred to as two-a-days .
12208,"Other parts of training camp include drills , meetings with coaches and other players at one 's position , weight training , and pre-season games ."
12209,The latter half of training camp leads directly into the exhibition season .
12210,"With NFL training camps starting in late-July , the biggest concern has been dehydration ."
12211,"In 2001 , Minnesota Vikings player Korey Stringer died of a medical condition based from dehydration and heatstroke ."
12212,The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies .
12213,"At each practice , every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field ; additionally , an ambulance must be present during practices ."
12214,"With NFL training camps beginning in late July , severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games ."
12215,"In 2002 , a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near Cleveland Browns Stadium , and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps ."
12216,"Fans are often able to visit their favorite team 's training camp to catch an early look at the players ; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket , making training camp trips a popular option for fans who can not attend many games due to financial or other reasons ."
12217,NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience .
12218,"In computing , a file system ( or filesystem ) is a type of data store which can be used to store , retrieve and update a set of files ."
12219,"The term could refer to the abstract data structures used to define files , or to the actual software or firmware components that implement the abstract ideas ."
12220,"Some file systems are used on local data storage devices ; others provide file access via a network protocol ( e.g . NFS , SMB , or 9P clients ) ."
12221,"Some file systems are `` virtual '' , in that the `` files '' supplied are computed on request ( e.g . procfs ) or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store ."
12222,The file system manages access to both the content of files and the metadata about those files .
12223,"It is responsible for arranging storage space ; reliability , efficiency , and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations ."
12224,"William Howard Taft ( September 15 , 1857 – March 8 , 1930 ) was the 27th President of the United States ( 1909–1913 ) and later the tenth Chief Justice of the United States ( 1921–1930 ) ."
12225,He is the only person to have served in both of these offices .
12226,"Before becoming President , Taft , a Republican , was selected to serve on the Superior Court of Cincinnati in 1887 ."
12227,"In 1890 , Taft was appointed Solicitor General of the United States and in 1891 a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ."
12228,"In 1900 , President William McKinley appointed Taft Governor-General of the Philippines ."
12229,"In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Taft Secretary of War in an effort to groom Taft , then his close political ally , into his handpicked presidential successor ."
12230,"Taft assumed a prominent role in problem solving , assuming on some occasions the role of acting Secretary of State , while declining repeated offers from Roosevelt to serve on the Supreme Court ."
12231,"Riding a wave of popular support for fellow Republican Roosevelt , Taft won an easy victory in his 1908 bid for the presidency ."
12232,"In his only term , Taft 's domestic agenda emphasized trust-busting , civil service reform , strengthening the Interstate Commerce Commission , improving the performance of the postal service , and passage of the Sixteenth Amendment ."
12233,"Abroad , Taft sought to further the economic development of nations in Latin America and Asia through `` Dollar Diplomacy `` , and showed decisiveness and restraint in response to revolution in Mexico ."
12234,"The task-oriented Taft was oblivious to the political ramifications of his decisions , often alienated his own key constituencies , and was overwhelmingly defeated in his bid for a second term in the presidential election of 1912 ."
12235,"In surveys of presidential scholars , Taft is usually ranked near the middle of lists of all American Presidents ."
12236,"After leaving office , Taft spent his time in academia , arbitration , and the search for world peace through his self-founded League to Enforce Peace ."
12237,"In 1921 , after the First World War , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft Chief Justice of the United States ."
12238,Taft served in this capacity until shortly before his death in 1930 .
12239,"The Ten Commandments is a 1956 epic film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille that dramatized the biblical story of the Exodus , in which the Hebrew-born Moses , an adopted Egyptian prince , becomes the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves ."

12243,"The Ten Commandments , which DeMille narrated , was the last film that he directed ."
12244,"He was set to direct the 1958 remake of his 1938 film The Buccaneer , but his final illness forced him to relinquish the directing chores to his son-in-law , actor Anthony Quinn ."
12245,"DeMille had also planned to film the life of Lord Baden Powell , the founder of the Scout movement , with David Niven ; this project was never realized ."
12246,The Ten Commandments is a partial remake of DeMille 's 1923 silent film .
12247,Some of the cast and crew of the 1956 version worked on the original .
12248,It has since been remade as a television miniseries broadcast in April 2006 .
12249,"The Ten Commandments is one of the most financially successful films ever made , grossing over $ 65 million at the U.S. box office ."
12250,"Adjusting for inflation , this makes it the sixth highest-grossing film domestically , with an adjusted total of $ 1,025,730,000 in 2012 ."
12251,The box office website `` The Numbers '' lists the domestic gross at $ 80 million .
12252,"In 1999 , The Ten Commandments was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' ."
12253,"In June 2008 , the American Film Institute revealed its `` Ten Top Ten `` —the best ten films in ten American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community ."
12254,The Ten Commandments was listed as the tenth best film in the epic genre .
12255,"The film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture , and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects ."
12256,Charlton Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor in the drama category .
12257,"Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his role as Rameses , along with his other roles in The King and I and Anastasia ."
12258,"Louisville ( , or ) is a major city and the largest city in the U.S. state of Kentucky and the county seat of Jefferson County ."
12259,"Since 2003 , the city 's borders have been with those of the county because of a city-county merger ."
12260,"The city 's total consolidated population at the 2010 census was 741,096 ( Louisville 's balance total , 602,011 , excludes semi-autonomous towns and is the population listed in most sources and national rankings ) ."
12261,"As of 2010 , the Louisville metropolitan area ( MSA ) had a population of 1,307,647 ranking 42nd nationally ."
12262,"The metro area includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 surrounding counties , eight in Kentucky and four in Southern Indiana ( see Geography below ) ."
12263,"The Louisville Combined Statistical Area , having a population of 1,451,564 , includes the MSA , Hardin County and Larue County in Kentucky , and Scott County , Indiana ."
12264,"An important internal shipping port in the 19th century , Louisville today is best known as the location of the Kentucky Derby , the first of three annual thoroughbred horse races making up the Triple Crown ."
12265,A typical experimental setup for an aldol reaction .
12266,Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath ( −78 °C ) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple ( the wire on the left ) .
12267,"A cooling bath , in laboratory chemistry ( often but not always organic chemistry ) practice , is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures , typically between 13 °C and −196 °C ."
12268,"These low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation , to remove solvents using a rotary evaporator , or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature ( see : kinetic control ) ."
12269,"Cooling baths are generally one of two types : ( a ) a cold fluid ( particularly liquid nitrogen , water , or even air ) — but most commonly the term refers to ( b ) a mixture of 3 components : ( 1 ) a cooling agent ( such as dry ice or water ice ) ; ( b ) a liquid 'carrier ' ( such as liquid water , ethylene glycol , acetone , etc . ) , which transfers heat between the bath and the vessel ; ; and ( c ) an additive to depress the melting-point of the solid/liquid system ."
12270,( A familiar example of this is the use of an ice/rock-salt mixture to freeze ice cream .
12271,"The phase-change of ice into liquid water requires energy , 'pulling ' heat from the system ."
12272,"Adding salt lowers the temp at which this happens , meaning more energy has to be absorbed from the environment in order to melt the ice ."
12273,This effectively makes the ice 'colder ' — it must 'pull ' more heat from its environment to become liquid . )
12274,Eating disorders are conditions defined by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive food intake to the detriment of an individual 's physical and mental health .
12275,Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most common specific forms in the United Kingdom .
12276,Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified .
12277,Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging .
12278,"Purging can include self-induce vomiting , over-exercising , and the usage of diuretics , enemas , and laxatives ."
12279,Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss .
12280,"Though primarily thought of as affecting females ( an estimated 5–10 million being affected in the U.K. ) , eating disorders affect males as well ."
12281,"An estimated 10 – 15 % of people with eating disorders are males ( Gorgan , 1999 ) ."
12282,( an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected ) .
12283,"Although eating disorders are increasing all over the world among both men and women , there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western world who are at the highest risk of developing them and the degree of westernization increases the risk ."
12284,Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder .
12285,"The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered , and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well ."
12286,"Interactions between motivational , homeostatic and self-regulatory control processes are involved in eating behaviour , which is a key component in eating disorders ."
12287,"The precise cause of eating disorders is not entirely understood , but there is evidence that it may be linked to other medical conditions and situations ."
12288,Cultural idealization of thinness and youthfulness have contributed to eating disorders affecting diverse populations .
12289,One study showed that girls with ADHD have a greater chance of getting an eating disorder than those not affected by ADHD .
12290,"Another study suggested that women with PTSD , especially due to sexually related trauma , are more likely to develop anorexia nervosa ."
12291,One study showed that foster girls are more likely to develop bulimia nervosa .
12292,Some think that peer pressure and idealized body-types seen in the media are also a significant factor .
12293,Some research show that for certain people there are genetic reasons why they may be prone to developing an eating disorder .
12294,Recent studies have found evidence a correlation between patients with bulimia nervosa and substance use disorders .
12295,"In addition , anxiety disorders and personality disorders are common occurrences with clients of eating disorders ."
12296,"While proper treatment can be highly effective for many suffering from specific types of eating disorders , the consequences of eating disorders can be severe , including death ( whether from direct medical effects of disturbed eating habits or from comorbid conditions such as suicidal thinking ) ."
12297,Slavery in the United States existed from the early years of the colonial period ; it was firmly established by the time the United States sought independence from Great Britain in 1776 .
12298,"However , by 1804 , all states north of the Mason and Dixon Line had either abolished slavery outright or passed laws for the gradual abolition of slavery ."
12299,In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory .
12300,"But slavery gained new life in the South with the cotton industry after 1800 , and expanded into the Southwest ."
12301,"The nation was polarized into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line , which separated Pennsylvania and Maryland ."
12302,"The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808 , but the domestic trade , with sales to the Deep South , expanded dramatically , and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade ."
12303,"Before the 1840s , the South was vigorously defending slavery and its expansion into the territories ."
12304,"In the North some abolitionists denounced it as sinful , and numerous anti-slavery forces rejected it as detrimental to the rights of free men ."
12305,"After failed compromises and Abraham Lincoln 's election , in 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the Confederate States of America , leading to the American Civil War ."
12306,The federal government in 1862 made abolition of slavery a war goal .
12307,In January 1863 President Lincoln freed slaves in the Confederacy through the Emancipation Proclamation .
12308,"After the war , the Thirteenth Amendment , effective December 1865 , abolished slavery throughout the entire United States , including the Border states and the Indian territories ."
12309,"From the 16th to the 19th centuries , an estimated 12 million Africans were shipped as slaves to the Americas ."
12310,See Slavery in the Americas .
12311,"The great majority went to the sugar plantations of the West Indies or Brazil , where mortality was high ."
12312,"About 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States ."
12313,"By the 1860 United States Census , the slave population in the American South had grown to four million ."
12314,"Of all 1,515,605 families in the 15 slave states , nearly 400,000 held slaves ( roughly one in four ) , amounting to 8 % of all American families ."
12315,"While some slaves worked as house servants and urban artisans , the great majority worked on plantations or large farms , cultivating lucrative cash crops , such as rice , tobacco , sugar and , after 1800 , chiefly cotton ."
12316,"By 1860 most slaves were held in the Deep South , where they served in work-gangs ; two-thirds worked in cotton ."
12317,"In small operations , they worked with their owners ."
12318,In large plantations they were directed by white paid overseers .
12319,"Under the system that became chattel slavery ( ownership of a human being , and of his/her descendants ) , a racial element was fundamental : slaves were blacks of African descent and owned , almost universally , by whites of European descent ."
12320,"In the 17th century , Virginia , followed by other southern colonies , enacted law that children of slave mothers were born into slavery ."
12321,"Slaves could gain freedom only by running away ( which was difficult and illegal to do ) , or by manumission by owners , which was regulated by states , and became increasingly difficult or prohibited ."
12322,"In the earliest era of chattel slavery , the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude ."
12323,"This typically lasted for several years for both poor Europeans and Africans alike , to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies ."
12324,They contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries .
12325,"Between 1680 and 1700 , as fewer Europeans migrated to the colonies , planters began to import more Africans as slaves ."
12326,"Recognizing the importance of slavery , the House of Burgesses in Virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705 ; it combined a variety of legislation and added new provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law ."
12327,This clock representation shows some of the major units of geological time and definitive events of Earth history .
12328,The Hadean eon represents the time before fossil record of life on Earth ; its upper boundary is now regarded as 4.0 Ga ( billion years ago ) .
12329,"Other subdivisions reflect the evolution of life ; the Archean and Proterozoic are both eons , the Palaeozoic , Mesozoic and Cenozoic are eras of the Phanerozoic eon ."
12330,"The two million year Quaternary period , the time of recognizable humans , is too small to be visible at this scale ."
12331,"The geologic time scale is a system of chronological measurement that relates stratigraphy to time , and is used by geologists , paleontologists , and other earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred throughout Earth 's history ."
12332,The table of geologic time spans presented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy standard color codes of the International Commission on Stratigraphy .
12333,Evidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old .
12334,The geology or deep time of Earth 's past has been organized into various units according to events which took place in each period .
12335,"Different spans of time on the GTS are usually delimited by changes in the composition of strata which correspond to them , indicating major geological or paleontological events , such as mass extinctions ."
12336,"For example , the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Paleogene period is defined by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , which marked the demise of the dinosaurs and many other groups of life ."
12337,Older time spans which predate the reliable fossil record ( before the Proterozoic Eon ) are defined by absolute age .
12338,The TI-82 is a graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments .
12339,"The TI-82 was designed in 1993 as a stripped down , more user friendly version of the TI-85 , and as a replacement for the TI-81 ."
12340,It was the direct predecessor of the TI-83 .
12341,It shares with the TI-85 a 6 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor .
12342,"Like the TI-81 , the TI-82 features a 96x64 pixel display , and the core feature set of the TI-81 with many new features ."
12343,The cast of characters of The King of Fighters XI .
12344,"The King of Fighters fighting game series , produced by SNK Playmore , includes a wide cast of characters , some of which are taken from other SNK games ."
12345,The story takes place in a fictional universe in which an annual series of 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 fighting tournaments are held .
12346,"The first game in the series introduces the initial main character of the series , Kyo Kusanagi , a young Japanese fighter who is the heir to a powerful group of martial artists having pyrokinetic abilities ."
12347,"Kyo fights against the Kusanagi clan 's enemies , his rival Iori Yagami , and the god Orochi and its human followers , among others ."
12348,"The first four games in the series revolve about these fights , while The King of Fighters '99 introduces a new story arc , revolving around K ' , a young man who seeks to destroy the mysterious NESTS organization because they kidnapped him at an early age and stripped him of his past memories , so that they could force him to be a fighter under their control ."
12349,"In The King of Fighters 2003 , a new character named Ash Crimson enters the tournament , to steal the powers of the clans who sealed the Orochi in the past for an unknown reason ."
12350,"A new group of antagonists , known as Those From the Past , also appears in the series ; they want to obtain Orochi 's power for the purpose of giving it to their unknown master ."
12351,The plot and the characters came from the Yamata no Orochi legend .
12352,"There are also several characters in the games that are parodies or homages to several popular anime , manga , and films ."
12353,"Merchandise based on the characters has also been released , including action figures and keychains ."
12354,The characters have garnered praise from several video game publications for the quality of their designs and movesets .
12355,"Comments focused on the lack of improvements in some of the characters , but added that the roster is greatly diverse ."
12356,"Whale Wars is a weekly American documentary-style reality television series that premiered on November 7 , 2008 on the Animal Planet cable channel ."
12357,"The program follows Paul Watson , founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , as he and the crew aboard their various vessels harass Japanese whalers off the coast of Antarctica ."
12358,"On January 5 , 2013 , Animal Planet renewed the series for a sixth season ."
12359,The Harpy Eagle ( Harpia harpyja ) is a Neotropical species of eagle .
12360,It is sometimes known as the American Harpy Eagle to distinguish it from the Papuan Eagle which is sometimes known as the New Guinea Harpy Eagle or Papuan Harpy Eagle .
12361,"It is the largest and most powerful raptor found in the Americas , and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world ."
12362,It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper ( emergent ) canopy layer .
12363,"Destruction of its natural habitat has seen it vanish from many parts of its former range , and it is nearly extirpated in Central America ."
12364,"Biological classification , or scientific classification in biology , is a method of scientific taxonomy used to group and categorize organisms into groups such as genus or species ."
12365,These groups are known as taxa ( singular : taxon ) .
12366,"Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus , who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics ."
12367,These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent .
12368,"With the introduction of the cladistic method in the late 20th century , phylogenetic taxonomy in which organisms are grouped based purely on inferred evolutionary relatedness , ignoring morphological similarity , has become common in some areas of biology ."
12369,"Molecular phylogenetics , which uses DNA sequences as data , has also driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue doing so ."
12370,Biological classification belongs to the science of biological systematics .

12390,The childlike Pee-wee Herman character developed as a stage act that quickly led to an HBO special in 1981 .
12391,"As the stage performance gained further popularity , Reubens took the character to motion picture with Pee-wee 's Big Adventure in 1985 , toning down the adult innuendo for the appeal of children ."

12401,Kansas ( ) is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States .
12402,"It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native American tribe , which inhabited the area ."
12403,"The tribe 's name ( natively kką : ze ) is often said to mean `` people of the wind '' or `` people of the south wind , '' although this was probably not the term 's original meaning ."
12404,Residents of Kansas are called `` Kansans . ''
12405,For thousands of years what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes .
12406,Tribes in the Eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys .
12407,Tribes in the Western part of the state were semi- nomadic and hunted large herds of bison .
12408,"Kansas was first settled by European Americans in the 1830s , but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue ."
12409,"When officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine if Kansas would become a free state or a slave state ."
12410,"Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas ."
12411,"The abolitionists eventually prevailed and on January 29 , 1861 , Kansas entered the Union as a free state ."

12415,Psychology is an academic and applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental functions and behaviors .
12416,"Psychology has the immediate goal of understanding individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases , and by many accounts it ultimately aims to benefit society ."
12417,"In this field , a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social , behavioral , or cognitive scientist ."
12418,"Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior , while also exploring the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie certain cognitive functions and behaviors ."
12419,"Psychologists explore concepts such as perception , cognition , attention , emotion , phenomenology , motivation , brain functioning , personality , behavior , and interpersonal relationships ."
12420,Psychologists of diverse stripes also consider the unconscious mind .
12421,Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables .
12422,"In addition , or in opposition , to employing empirical and deductive methods , some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques ."
12423,"Psychology has been described as a `` hub science '' , with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences , natural sciences , medicine , and the humanities , such as philosophy ."
12424,"While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems , it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in many different spheres of human activity ."
12425,"The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role , practicing in clinical , counseling , or school settings ."
12426,"Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior , and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings ( e.g. , medical schools , hospitals ) ."
12427,"Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings , or in other areas such as human development and aging , sports , health , and the media , as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law ."
12428,"Thomas Jefferson ( April 13 , 1743 ( April 2 , 1743 O.S. ) – July 4 , 1826 ) was an American Founding Father , the principal author of the Declaration of Independence ( 1776 ) and the third President of the United States ( 1801–1809 ) ."
12429,"At the beginning of the American Revolution , he served in the Continental Congress , representing Virginia and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia ( 1779–1781 ) ."
12430,"Just after the war ended , from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat , stationed in Paris ."
12431,"In May 1785 , he became the United States Minister to France ."

12438,"In 1803 , President Jefferson initiated a process of Indian tribal removal and relocation to the Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi River , in order to open lands for eventual American settlers ."
12439,"A leader in the Enlightenment , Jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages fluently and was deeply interested in science , invention , architecture , religion and philosophy , interests that led him to the founding of the University of Virginia after his presidency ."
12440,"He designed his own large mansion on a 5,000 acre plantation near Charlottesville , Virginia , which he named Monticello ."
12441,"While not a notable orator , Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe throughout his adult life ."
12442,"Though Jefferson owned many slaves , he opposed the institution all his life and consequently treated and took care of them very well and expected them to work no more than free farmers ."
12443,"Since 1802 historians and others have been divided over the controversy of whether Jefferson was the father of one or more children belonging to Sally Hemings , a slave at Monticello . ''"
12444,Historians are also in disagreement with how much Jefferson was committed to the anti-slavery cause .
12445,"In 1807 , President Jefferson signed into law a bill that banned the importation of slaves into the United States ."

12455,The league adopted its current name at the start of the when it merged with the National Basketball League ( NBL ) .
12456,The NBA Finals is the championship series for the NBA and the conclusion of the sport 's postseason .
12457,The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy .
12458,Players from the winning team usually receive championship rings from the team honoring their contribution .
12459,"However , in some rare occasion , the teams opted to gave other commemorative items , such as wrist watches , instead of rings ."
12460,The number of championships won by NBA superstars is often used as a measurement of their greatness .
12461,Boston Celtics center Bill Russell holds the record for the most NBA championships won with 11 titles during his 13-year playing career .
12462,He won his first championship with the Boston Celtics in his rookie year .

12474,"Accuracy indicates proximity of measurement results to the true value , precision to the repeatability , or reproducibility of the measurement"
12475,"In the fields of science , engineering , industry , and statistics , the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity 's actual ( true ) value ."
12476,"The precision of a measurement system , also called reproducibility or repeatability , is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results ."
12477,"Although the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use , they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method ."
12478,"A measurement system can be accurate but not precise , precise but not accurate , neither , or both ."
12479,"For example , if an experiment contains a systematic error , then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy ."
12480,The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment .
12481,Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision .
12482,A measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and precise .
12483,Related terms include bias ( non- random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable ) and error ( random variability ) .
12484,"The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is , values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data ."
12485,"In addition to accuracy and precision , measurements may also have a measurement resolution , which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement ."
12486,"In the case of full reproducibility , such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number , the word precision has a meaning not related to reproducibility ."
12487,"For example , in the IEEE 754-2008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand , so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented ."
12488,"Animated , color-coded map showing the various continents and regions ."
12489,"Depending on the convention and model , some continents may be consolidated or subdivided : for example , Eurasia is most often subdivided into Europe and Asia ( red shades ) , while North and South America are sometimes recognized as one American continent ( green shades ) ."
12490,A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth .
12491,"They are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria , with up to seven regions commonly regarded as continents—they are ( from largest in size to smallest ) : Asia , Africa , North America , South America , Antarctica , Europe , and Australia ."
12492,"In geology , continents are described by means of tectonic plates ."

12498,Community property is a marital property regime that originated in civil law jurisdictions and is now also found in some common law jurisdictions .
12499,"The states of the United States that recognize community property are primarily in the West ; it was inherited from Mexico 's ganancial community system , which itself was inherited from Spanish law ( a Roman -derived civil law system ) and ultimately from the Visigoths ."
12500,"While under Spanish rule Louisiana adopted the ganancial community system of acquests and gains , which replaced the traditional French community of movables and acquests in its civil law system ."
12501,Map of the United States with community property states highlighted in red .
12502,"In addition to the highlighted states , Alaska is a separate property state that permits couples to opt into a community property arrangement ."
12503,"In a community property jurisdiction , most property acquired during the marriage ( except for gifts or inheritances ) —the community , or communio bonorum—is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce , annulment or death ."
12504,Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property .
12505,"Division of community property may take place by item , by splitting all items or by value ."
12506,"In some jurisdictions , such as California , a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute , meaning that the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or separate property ."
12507,"In other jurisdictions , such as Texas , a divorce court may decree an `` equitable distribution `` of community property , which may result in an unequal division of such ."
12508,In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution .
12509,"Generally speaking , the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift , bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property ( i.e. , not community property ) ."
12510,See division of property .
12511,Division of community debts may not be the same as division of community property .
12512,"For example , in California , community property is required to be divided `` equally '' while community debt is required to be divided `` equitably '' ."
12513,"Property that is owned by one spouse before the marriage is the separate property of that spouse , unless the property is `` transmuted '' into community property ."
12514,The rules for this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .

12560,The five sets of the board game Monopoly depicted here show the evolution of the game 's artwork and designs in the United States from 1935–2005 .
12561,The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century .
12562,"The earliest known design was by the American , Elizabeth Magie , patented in 1904 but existing as early as 1902 ."
12563,"Magie 's original intent was to publish a board game to illustrate an economic principle , namely the Georgist concept of a single land value tax ."
12564,A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land .
12565,"By 1934 , a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century , and into the 21st ."
12566,"Several people , mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution ."
12567,"By the 1970s , the idea that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore ; it was printed in the game 's instructions for many years , in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly , and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007 ."
12568,"Even a guide to family games published for Reader 's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie , erroneously stating that Magie 's original game was created in the 1800s , and not acknowledging any of the game 's development between Magie 's creation of the game , and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers ."
12569,"Also in the 1970s , Professor Ralph Anspach , who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and trust busting , fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company , General Mills , over the trademarks of the Monopoly board game ."
12570,"Through the research of Anspach and others , much of the early history of the game was `` rediscovered '' ."
12571,"Anspach confronted Maxine Brady , author of the 1974 book The Monopoly Book : Strategy and Tactics of the World 's Most Popular Game over the actual history of the game on Barry Farber 's New York City talk show in 1975 ."
12572,"Because of the lengthy court process , including appeals , the legal status of Parker Brothers ' trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985 ."
12573,"The game 's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers , as do its specific design elements ."
12574,"At the conclusion of the court case , the game 's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand , licensed by Parker Brothers ' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day ."
12575,"Despite the `` rediscovery '' of the board game 's early history in the 1970s and 1980s , and several books and journal articles on the subject , Hasbro ( Parker Brothers ' current parent company ) did not acknowledge any of the game 's history before Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012 ."
12576,"Nor did Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them , at least as recently as 2006 ."
12577,"International tournaments , first held in the early 1970s , continue to the present , with the next world championship likely scheduled for 2013 ."
12578,"Starting in 1985 , a new generation of spin-off board games and card games appeared on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ."
12579,"In 1989 , the first of many video game and computer game editions was published ."

12681,"Reference is also given to their place of origin , such as `` Spanish horses , '' but whether this referred to one breed or several is unknown ."
12682,"Another difficulty arising during any study of medieval documents or literature is the flexibility of the medieval languages , where several words can be used for one thing ( or , conversely , several objects are referred to by one word ) ."

12785,Historia
12786,by Nikolaos Gysis ( 1892 )
12787,"History ( from Greek - historia , meaning `` inquiry , knowledge acquired by investigation '' ) is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the discovery , collection , organization , and presentation of information about these events ."
12788,"The term includes cosmic , geologic , and organic history , but is often generically implied to mean human history ."
12789,Scholars who write about history are called historians .
12790,"History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events , and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them ."
12791,Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing `` perspective '' on the problems of the present .
12792,"Stories common to a particular culture , but not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not support the `` disinterested investigation '' required of the discipline of history ."
12793,Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory .
12794,"Herodotus , a 5th century B.C . Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the `` father of history '' , and , along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history ."

12829,The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
12830,"As households tend to share a similar economic context , the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income ."
12831,"That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories , and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible ."

12856,She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use .
12857,"Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard ."
12858,"Because of outdated maritime safety regulations , she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number travelling on the maiden voyage , and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity ."
12859,"After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York ."
12860,"On 14 April 1912 , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship 's time ."
12861,The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; the ship gradually filled with water .
12862,"Meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partly loaded ."
12863,A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a `` women and children first `` protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats .
12864,"By 2:20 AM , she broke apart and foundered , with well over one thousand people still aboard ."
12865,"Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered , the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors ."
12866,The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it .
12867,Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety .
12868,"One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) , which still governs maritime safety today ."
12869,"Additionally , several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- -which could have saved many more passengers ."
12870,"Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute ; many families , particularly those of crew members from Southampton , lost their primary bread-winners ."
12871,They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations .

12940,The American middle class is a social class in the United States .
12941,"While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use , contemporary social scientists have put forward several , more or less congruent , theories on the American middle class ."
12942,"Depending on class model used , the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25 % to 66 % of households ."
12943,"One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was White Collar : The American Middle Classes , published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Wright_Mills Mills Wright_Mills ."
12944,Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups .
12945,"Constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated , salaried professionals and managers ."
12946,"Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals , skilled craftsmen and lower-level management ."
12947,"Middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living , significant economic security , considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves ."
12948,Members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other .
12949,"Overall , middle-class persons , especially upper-middle-class individuals , are characterized by conceptualizing , creating and consulting ."
12950,"Thus , college education is one of the main indicators of middle-class status ."

12952,"Politically more active than other demographics , college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties ."
12953,"Income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of $ 100,000 ."
12954,"Household income figures , however , do not always reflect class status and standard of living , as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size ."
12955,"It is therefore possible for a large , dual-earner , lower middle class household to out-earn a small , one-earner , upper middle class household ."
12956,"The middle classes are very influential , as they encompass the majority of voters , writers , teachers , journalists , and editors ."

12961,"Ruins from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in United States history"
12962,"A disaster is a natural or man-made ( or technological ) hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction , loss of life , or drastic change to the environment ."
12963,"A disaster can be ostensively defined as any tragic event stemming from events such as earthquakes , floods , catastrophic accidents , fires , or explosions ."
12964,"It is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life and property and destroy the economic , social and cultural life of people ."
12965,"In contemporary academia , disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk ."
12966,These risks are the product of a combination of both hazard/s and vulnerability .
12967,"Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters , as is the case in uninhabited regions ."
12968,"Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by disasters occur in developing countries , and losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater ( as a percentage of GDP ) in developing countries than in industrialized countries ."
12969,"In computing , booting ( also known as booting up ) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on ."
12970,"The process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is re-energized after being turned off , and ends when the computer is ready to perform its normal operations ."
12971,"On modern general purpose computers , this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a power-on self-test , locating and initializing peripheral devices , and then finding , loading and starting an operating system ."
12972,"Many computer systems also allow these operations to be initiated by a software command without cycling power , in what is known as a soft reboot , though some of the initial operations might be skipped on a soft reboot ."
12973,A boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the self-tests .
12974,The computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by one 's bootstraps .
12975,"The usage calls attention to the requirement that , if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer , some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computer ."
12976,Early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem .
12977,The invention of integrated circuit read-only memory ( ROM ) of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erased .
12978,Growth in the capacity of ROM has allowed ever more elaborate start up procedures to be implemented .
12979,"On general purpose computers , the boot process begins with the execution of an initial program stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashion ."
12980,"In some older computers , the initial program might have been the application to run , if no operating system was used , or the operating system ."
12981,"In other computers , the initial program is a boot loader that may then load into random-access memory ( RAM ) , from nonvolatile secondary storage ( such as a hard disk drive ) or , in some older computers , from a medium such as punched cards , punched tape , or magnetic tape in older computers , the binary code of an operating system or runtime environment and then execute it ."
12982,"If the boot loader is limited in its size and capabilities , it may , instead , load a larger and more capable secondary boot loader , which would then load the operating system or runtime environment ."
12983,Some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in ROM .
12984,"Firebird is an open source SQL relational database management system that runs on Linux , Windows , and a variety of Unix ."

12986,Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization .
12987,The practice of contracting a business process out to a third party rather than staffing it internally is common in the modern economy .
12988,The term `` outsourcing '' became popular in the United States near the turn of the 21st century .
12989,"Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another , but not always ."
12990,"The definition of outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting , and sometimes includes offshoring , which means relocating a business function to another country ."
12991,Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for outsourcing/offshoring .
12992,"The opposite of outsourcing is called insourcing , which entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house , and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration ."
12993,"However , a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily insourcing that business process ."
12994,"Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a lentivirus ( slowly replicating retrovirus ) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive ."
12995,"Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood , semen , vaginal fluid , pre-ejaculate , or breast milk ."
12996,"Within these bodily fluids , HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells ."
12997,"HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells ( specifically CD4 + T cells ) , macrophages , and dendritic cells ."
12998,"HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms including : apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells ."
12999,"When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections ."

13005,"The books centre on a magical English nanny , Mary Poppins ."
13006,"She is blown by the East wind to Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane , London , and into the Banks ' household to care for their children ."
13007,"Encounters with chimney sweeps , shopkeepers and various adventures follow until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves , i.e. , `` pops-out '' ."
13008,The adventures take place over a total of eight books .

13026,Written Simlish
13027,Simlish is a fictional language featured in EA Games ' Sim series of games .
13028,"It debuted in SimCopter , and has been especially prominent in The Sims , The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 ."
13029,"The Sims development team created the unique Simlish language by experimenting with fractured Ukrainian , French , Latin , Finnish , English , Fijian , Cebuano , and Tagalog ."
13030,"Simlish can also be heard in SimCity 4 , SimCity Societies and SimCity 2013 , but far less frequently ."
13031,Civilized Creatures in Spore can also be taught to speak Simlish .
13032,It is also featured to an extent in Firaxis Games ' Sid Meier 's SimGolf .
13033,"Designer Will Wright was conscious of the need for dialogue in the game , but thought that using a real language would make it sound too repetitive and would also be too costly to hire translators for world languages ."
13034,"Initially , inspired by the Native American code talkers of World War II , Sims creator Will Wright and language expert Marc Gimbel suggested experimenting with the Navajo language to create Simlish ."
13035,"However , they ultimately decided that Simlish worked best as a `` language '' made up of gibberish words that could n't be translated , so that its meaning would be left open to the imagination of the player ."
13036,"Wright later commented that using `` nonsense language '' turned out to be the right development choice , as people were capable of imagining it more realistically than a computer could simulate a real one ."
13037,The actual sound of Simlish was created improvisationally by voice actors Stephen Kearin and Gerri Lawlor .
13038,An example of Ultrasonic Testing ( UT ) on blade roots of a V2500 IAE aircraft engine .
13039,Step 1 : The UT probe is placed on the root of the blades to be inspected with the help of a special borescope tool ( video probe ) .
13040,Step 2 : Instrument settings are input .
13041,Step 3 : The probe is scanned over the blade root .
13042,"In this case , an indication ( peak in the data ) through the red line ( or gate ) indicates a good blade ; an indication to the left of that range indicates a crack ."
13043,Principle of ultrasonic testing .
13044,LEFT : A probe sends a sound wave into a test material .
13045,"There are two indications , one from the initial pulse of the probe , and the second due to the back wall echo ."
13046,RIGHT : A defect creates a third indication and simultaneously reduces the amplitude of the back wall indication .
13047,The depth of the defect is determined by the ratio D/E
13048,"In ultrasonic testing ( UT ) , very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz and occasionally up to 50 MHz are launched into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials ."
13049,"A common example is ultrasonic thickness measurement , which tests the thickness of the test object , for example , to monitor pipework corrosion ."
13050,"Ultrasonic testing is often performed on steel and other metals and alloys , though it can also be used on concrete , wood and composites , albeit with less resolution ."
13051,"It is a form of non-destructive testing used in many industries including aerospace , automotive and other transportation sectors ."
13052,"The vas deferens ( plural : vasa deferentia ) , also called ductus deferens ( Latin : `` carrying-away vessel '' ; plural : ductus deferentes ) , is part of the male anatomy of many vertebrates ; they transport sperm from the epididymis in anticipation of ejaculation ."

13054,"In medicine , ischemia , also spelled as ischaemia or ischæmia , ( ; from Greek language ισχαιμία , ischaimía ; isch- root denoting a restriction or thinning or to make or grow thin/lean , haema blood ) is a restriction in blood supply to tissues , causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism ( to keep tissue alive ) ."
13055,"Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels , with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue ."
13056,"It also means local anemia in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion ( such as vasoconstriction , thrombosis or embolism ) ."
13057,"Down syndrome ( DS ) or Down 's syndrome , also known as trisomy 21 , is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21 ."
13058,Down syndrome is the most common chromosome abnormality in humans .
13059,"It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability ( mental retardation , or MR ) and physical growth , and a particular set of facial characteristics ."
13060,"The average IQ of young adults with Down syndrome is around 50 , whereas young adults without the condition typically have an IQ of 100 ."
13061,( MR has historically been defined as an IQ below 70 . )
13062,A large proportion of individuals with Down syndrome have a severe degree of intellectual disability .
13063,"Down syndrome is named after John Langdon Down , the British physician who described the syndrome in 1866 ."
13064,The condition was clinically described earlier by Jean Etienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and Edouard Seguin in 1844 .
13065,Down syndrome was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by Dr. Jérôme Lejeune in 1959 .
13066,Down syndrome can be identified in a baby at birth or before birth by prenatal screening .
13067,Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated .
13068,The CDC estimates that about one of every 691 babies born in the United States each year is born with Down syndrome .
13069,Many children with Down syndrome are educated in regular school classes while others require specialised educational facilities .
13070,"Some children graduate from high school , and , in the US , there are increasing opportunities for participating in post-secondary education ."
13071,Education and proper care has been shown to improve quality of life significantly .
13072,"Many adults with Down Syndrome are able to work at paid employment in the community , while others require a more sheltered work environment ."
13073,"Hot flashes ( also known as hot flushes , or night sweats if they happen at night ) are a symptom which may have several other causes , but which is often caused by the changing hormone levels that are characteristic of menopause ."
13074,"The Servicemen 's Readjustment Act of 1944 ( P.L . 78-346 , 58 Stat . 284m ) , known informally as the G.I . Bill , was a law that provided a range of benefits for returning World War II veterans ( commonly referred to as G.I.s ) ."
13075,"Benefits included low-cost mortgages , low-interest loans to start a business or farm , cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend college , high school or vocational education , as well as one year of unemployment compensation ."
13076,It was available to every veteran who had been on active duty during the war years for at least ninety days and had not been dishonorably discharged ; combat was not required .
13077,"By the end of the program in 1956 , roughly 2.2 million veterans had used the G.I . Bill education benefits in order to attend colleges or universities , and an additional 6.6 million used these benefits for some kind of training program ."
13078,"Since the original 1944 law , the term has come to include other veteran benefit programs created to assist veterans of subsequent wars as well as peacetime service ."
13079,Historians and economists consider the G.I . Bill a major political success—especially in contrast to the treatments of World War I veterans—and a major contribution to America 's stock of human capital that sped long-term economic growth .
13080,"The Watergate scandal was a political scandal that occurred in the United States in the 1970s as a result of the June 17 , 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington , D.C. , and the Nixon administration 's attempted cover-up of its involvement ."
13081,"The scandal eventually led to the resignation of Richard Nixon , the President of the United States , on August 9 , 1974 — the only resignation of a U.S. President ."
13082,"The scandal also resulted in the indictment , trial , conviction , and incarceration of forty-three persons , dozens of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials ."
13083,"The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate complex on June 17 , 1972 ."
13084,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) connected cash found on the burglars to a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President , the official organization of Nixon 's campaign ."
13085,"In July 1973 , as evidence mounted against the president 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee , it was revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and he had recorded many conversations ."
13086,"Recordings from these tapes implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up the questionable ( and illegal ) goings-on that had taken place during his administration , both before and after the break-in ."
13087,"After a protracted series of bitter court battles , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president had to hand over the tapes to government investigators ; he ultimately complied ."

13094,"The United States presidency of Ronald Reagan , also known as the Reagan administration , was a Republican administration headed by Ronald Reagan from January 20 , 1981 , to January 20 , 1989 ."
13095,"Domestically , the administration favored reducing government programs and introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in American history ."
13096,"The economic policies enacted in 1981 , known as `` Reaganomics `` , were an example of supply-side economics ."
13097,"Reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and limit the growth of social spending , as well as the reduction of regulation and inflation ."
13098,"Economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s , helping Reagan to win a landslide re-election ."
13099,"The national debt increased significantly , however ."
13100,"Regarding foreign policy , the administration was steadfastly anti-communist , calling the Soviet Union an `` evil empire `` and ending 1970s détente ."
13101,"Reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor , including an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War ."

13104,"In diplomacy , Reagan forged a strong alliance with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and he met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev four times , aiming to shrink the superpowers ' nuclear arsenals ."
13105,"Reagan 's presidency has been termed the `` Reagan Revolution '' , or the Age of Reagan in recognition of the political realignment both within and beyond the U.S. in favor of his brand of conservatism and his faith in free markets ."
13106,"The Reagan administration worked toward the collapse of Soviet Communism , and it did collapse just as he left office ."
13107,Victory in the Cold War led to a unipolar world with the U.S. as the world 's sole superpower .
13108,"While the damaging Iran-Contra affair engulfed several Reagan aides during his second term , Reagan himself left office with a 63 percent approval rating , one of the higher approval ratings of departing presidents ."
13109,"After years of unstinting praise from the right , and unrelenting criticism from the left , historian David Henry finds that by 2009 a consensus had emerged among scholars that Reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a `` pragmatic conservatism '' that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system ."
13110,"Furthermore , says Henry , the consensus viewpoint agrees that he revived faith in the presidency and American self-confidence , and contributed critically to ending the Cold War ."
13111,Crude death rate by country ( 2006 ) .
13112,"Mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths ( in general , or due to a specific cause ) in a population ."
13113,"Scaled to the size of that population , per unit of time ."
13114,"Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year ; thus , a mortality rate of 9.5 ( out of 1000 ) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population , or 0.95 % out of the total ."
13115,"It is distinct from morbidity rate , which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period ( the prevalence rate ) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ( incidence rate ) ."
13116,"The term `` mortality `` is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury , rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group ."
13117,This disease mortality statistic is more precisely referred to as `` case fatality rate `` ( CFR ) .
13118,One distinguishes:
13119,"The crude death rate , the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people ."
13120,the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 per 1000 per year according to the current CIA World Factbook .
13121,"The perinatal mortality rate , the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths ( stillbirths ) per 1000 births ."
13122,"The maternal mortality ratio , the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in same time period ."
13123,"The maternal mortality rate , the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population ( generally defined as 15–44 years of age ) ."
13124,"The infant mortality rate , the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live births ."
13125,"The child mortality rate , the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live births ."
13126,"The standardised mortality ratio ( SMR ) - This represents a proportional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age , gender , etc ."
13127,The age-specific mortality rate ( ASMR ) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age ( e.g . age 62 last birthday ) .
13128,"In regard to the or failure of medical treatment or procedures , one would also distinguish:"
13129,"The early mortality rate , the total number of deaths in the early stages of an ongoing treatment , or in the period immediately following an treatment ."
13130,"The late mortality rate , the total number of deaths in the late stages of an ongoing treatment , or a significant length of time after an acute treatment ."
13131,Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression .
13132,The crude death rate depends on the age ( and gender ) specific mortality rates and the age ( and gender ) distribution of the population .
13133,"The number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries , despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better ."
13134,"This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution , with a much higher proportion of older people , due to both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates ."
13135,A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate separately for each age .
13136,A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy .
13137,An otoacoustic emission ( OAE ) is a sound which is generated from within the inner ear .
13138,"Having been predicted by Thomas Gold in 1948 , its existence was first demonstrated experimentally by David Kemp in 1978 and otoacoustic emissions have since been shown to arise by a number of different cellular mechanisms within the inner ear ."
13139,"Studies have shown that OAEs disappear after the inner ear has been damaged , so OAEs are often used in the laboratory and the clinic as a measure of inner ear health ."
13140,"Broadly speaking , there are two types of otoacoustic emissions : spontaneous otoacoustic emissions ( SOAEs ) , which can occur without external stimulation , and evoked otoacoustic emissions ( EOAEs ) , which require an evoking stimulus ."
13141,Hurricane Tomas was the nineteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season .
13142,Tomas developed from a tropical wave east of the Windward Islands on October 29 .
13143,"Quickly intensifying into a hurricane , it moved through the Windward Islands and passed very near Saint Lucia ."
13144,"After reaching Category 2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale , Tomas quickly weakened to a tropical storm in the central Caribbean Sea , due to strong wind shear and dry air ."
13145,Tomas later regained hurricane status as it reorganized near the Windward passage .
13146,"Throughout the hurricane 's path , 71 people are known to have been killed , 14 of whom were in Saint Lucia ."
13147,"Monetary losses throughout the Windward Islands were estimated at US $ 588 million , mainly in Saint Lucia ."
13148,"In the wake of the storm in Haiti , flooding intensified an ongoing cholera outbreak indirectly causing more fatalities ."
13149,"According to a report released in December 2010 , 55 people were killed in Cuba and Hispanola , though the distribution of these fatalities are unknown ."
13150,Overall damage from the storm was at least $ 741 million .

13153,"Postmodern literature is literature characterized by heavy reliance on techniques like fragmentation , paradox , and questionable narrators , and is often ( though not exclusively ) defined as a style or trend which emerged in the post–World War II era ."
13154,Postmodern works are seen as a reaction against Enlightenment thinking and Modernist approaches to literature .
13155,"Postmodern literature , like postmodernism as a whole , tends to resist definition or classification as a `` movement '' ."
13156,"Indeed , the convergence of postmodern literature with various modes of critical theory , particularly reader-response and deconstructionist approaches , and the subversions of the implicit contract between author , text and reader by which its works are often characterised , have led to pre-modern fictions such as Cervantes ' Don Quixote ( 1605,1615 ) and Laurence Sterne 's eighteenth-century satire Tristram Shandy being retrospectively inducted into the fold ."
13157,"While there is little consensus on the precise characteristics , scope , and importance of postmodern literature , as is often the case with artistic movements , postmodern literature is commonly defined in relation to a precursor ."
13158,"For example , a postmodern literary work tends not to conclude with the neatly tied-up ending as is often found in modernist literature , but often parodies it ."
13159,"Postmodern authors tend to celebrate chance over craft , and further employ metafiction to undermine the writer 's authority ."
13160,"Another characteristic of postmodern literature is the questioning of distinctions between high and low culture through the use of pastiche , the combination of subjects and genres not previously deemed fit for literature ."

13376,A small submersible AC sump pump with a garden hose connector
13377,"A sump pump is a pump used to remove water that has accumulated in a water collecting sump basin , commonly found in the basement of homes ."
13378,"The water may enter via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system , funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water , if the basement is below the water table level ."
13379,Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to remedy dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home .
13380,"Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic , such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well ."
13381,Pumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations .
13382,"Once considered acceptable , this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws , because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system ."

13387,"Usually hardwired into a home 's electrical system , sump pumps may have a battery backup ."
13388,"The home 's pressurized water supply powers some pumps , eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable water , potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem ."
13389,"Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped , a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time , as during a severe storm ."
13390,There are generally two types of sump pumps — pedestal and submersible .
13391,"The pedestal pump 's motor is mounted above the sump , where it is more easily serviced , but is also more conspicuous ."
13392,"The pump impeller is driven by a long , vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump ."
13393,"The submersible pump is entirely mounted inside the sump , and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits ."
13394,Sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table -related problems in surface soil .
13395,An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation .
13396,"As long as the pump functions , the surface soil will remain stable ."
13397,These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more ; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout .
13398,They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in .

13404,"The events later known as Bleeding Kansas were set into motion by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 , which nullified the Missouri Compromise and instead implemented the concept of popular sovereignty ."
13405,"An ostensibly democratic idea , popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state ; however , this resulted in immigration en masse to Kansas by activists from both sides ."
13406,"At one point , Kansas had two separate governments , each with its own constitution , although only one was federally recognized ."
13407,"On January 29 , 1861 , Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state , less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumter which began the Civil War ."

13425,Take identical growing plants and give fertilizer to half of them .
13426,"If there are differences between the fertilized plant group and the unfertilized `` control '' group , these differences may be due to the fertilizer ."
13427,A scientific control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable .
13428,"This increases the reliability of the results , often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements ."
13429,Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method .
13430,"For example , during drug testing , scientists will try to control two groups to keep them as identical as possible , then allow one group to try the drug ."
13431,"Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden : the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group , because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against ."
13432,"Without a control group , the experiment can not determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated ."
13433,"Ideally , all variables in an experiment will be controlled ( accounted for by the control measurements ) and none will be uncontrolled ."
13434,"In such an experiment , if all the controls work as expected , it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested ."
13435,"That is , scientific controls allow an investigator to make a claim like `` Two situations were identical until factor X occurred ."
13436,"Since factor X is the only difference between the two situations , the new outcome was caused by factor X . ''"

13441,Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution .
13442,"A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence ."

13445,"A political theorist and historian , Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought ."
13446,"One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States ."
13447,Adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .

13466,"William Bell Scott Iron and Coal , 1855-60"
13467,The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians .

13469,Some 20th-century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer .

13662,Minimalism is any design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect .
13663,"As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art , most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s ."
13664,"Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd , John McCracken , Agnes Martin , Dan Flavin , Robert Morris , Anne Truitt , and Frank Stella ."
13665,"It is rooted in the reductive aspects of Modernism , and is often interpreted as a reaction against Abstract expressionism and a bridge to Postminimal art practices ."

13671,"In chemistry and physics , Dalton 's law ( also called Dalton 's law of partial pressures ) states that the total pressure exerted by the mixture of non-reactive gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases ."
13672,This empirical law was observed by John Dalton in 1801 and is related to the ideal gas laws .
13673,"Mathematically , the pressure of a mixture of gases can be defined as the summation"
13674,or
13675,where represent the partial pressure of each component .
13676,It is assumed that the gases do not react with each other
13677,where is the mole fraction of the i-th component in the total mixture of n components .
13678,The relationship below provides a way to determine the volume based concentration of any individual gaseous component
13679,where is the concentration of the i-th component expressed in ppm .
13680,Dalton 's law is not exactly followed by real gases .
13681,Those deviations are considerably large at high pressures .
13682,"In such conditions , the volume occupied by the molecules can become significant compared to the free space between them ."
13683,"In particular , the short average distances between molecules raises the intensity of intermolecular forces between gas molecules enough to substantially change the pressure exerted by them ."
13684,Neither of those effects are considered by the ideal gas model .

13727,Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level .
13728,"Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations : the AFL-CIO created in 1955 , and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005 ."
13729,"Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada , and take an active role in politics ."
13730,The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues .

13738,"To fight alleged employer anti-union programs , unions are currently advocating new `` card check `` federal legislation that would require employers to bargain with a union if more than 50 % of workers signed forms , or `` cards , '' stating they wish to be represented by that union ."
13739,The current procedure involves waiting 45 to 90 days for a federally supervised secret-ballot employee referendum on the subject .
13740,"The economist Joseph Stiglitz has asserted that , `` Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality , whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs , sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape , to increase it . ''"

13753,This may be referred to as boutique manufacturing .
13754,"For example , before the release of the Wii , a Time Magazine article suggested that Nintendo could become a `` boutique video-game company '' , producing games for niche audiences , rather than trying to compete directly with Microsoft and Sony ."

13781,"Moreover a wide variety of central nervous system diseases , from both external substances and internal physiologic illness , can produce symptoms of psychosis ."
13782,This led many professionals to say that psychosis is not specific enough as a diagnostic term .
13783,"Despite this , `` psychosis '' is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior ( negative signs ) and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs ( e.g . grandiosity , delusions of persecution ) ."

13785,"An excess in dopaminergic signalling is traditionally linked to the positive symptoms of psychosis , especially those of schizophrenia ."
13786,This is thought to occur through a mechanism of aberrant salience of environmental stimuli .
13787,"Many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system ; meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs , however , show either no significant difference between drug and placebo , or a very small effect size , suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system ."

13817,The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat .
13818,A PVC may be perceived as a `` skipped beat `` or felt as palpitations in the chest .
13819,"In a normal heartbeat , the ventricles contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting ; in this way the ventricles can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body ."
13820,"In a PVC , the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood , which means that circulation is inefficient ."
13821,"However , single beat PVC arrhythmias do not usually pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in healthy individuals ."

13859,"Prior to Three Rivers , the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field ."
13860,Three different kinds of wheat and rye flour
13861,"Flour is a powder which is made by grinding cereal grains , or other seeds or roots ( like Cassava ) ."
13862,"It is the main ingredient of bread , which is a staple food for many cultures , making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history ."
13863,"Wheat flour is one of the most important foods in European , North American , Middle Eastern , Indian and North African cultures , and is the defining ingredient in most of their styles of breads and pastries ."
13864,"While wheat is the most common base for flour , corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times , and remains a staple throughout the Americas ."
13865,"Rye flour is an important constituent of bread in much of central Europe , and rice can also be used in flour , though this is relatively uncommon ."
13866,"Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time , typically expressed as beats per minute ( bpm ) ."
13867,"Heart rate can vary as the body 's need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes , such as during physical exercise , sleep , illness , or as a result of ingesting drugs :"
13868,Central nervous system stimulants such as amphetamines increase heart rate .
13869,"Central nervous system depressants or sedatives decreases the heart rate ( apart from some particularly strange ones with equally strange effects , such as ketamine which can cause - amongst many other things - stimulant-like effects such as tachycardia ) ."
13870,There are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down .
13871,"Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain , many of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed ' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs ."
13872,"Due to individuals having a constant blood volume , one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often ."
13873,Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm .
13874,Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm .
13875,"However , heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention ."
13876,"Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm , though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm , mainly if they are present during sleep , may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia ( see below ) ."
13877,"Catherine II 's carved , painted and gilded Coronation Coach ( Hermitage Museum )"
13878,"A carriage is a wheeled vehicle for people , usually horse-drawn ; litters ( palanquins ) and sedan chairs are excluded , since they are wheelless vehicles ."
13879,"The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use and for comfort or elegance , though some are also used to transport goods ."
13880,"It may be light , smart and fast or heavy , large and comfortable ."
13881,"Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs , elliptical springs ( in the 19th century ) or leather strapping ."
13882,"A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage – terms for such include stagecoach , charabanc and omnibus ."
13883,"Working vehicles such as the ( four-wheeled ) wagon and ( two-wheeled ) cart share important parts of the history of the carriage , as is the fast ( two-wheeled ) chariot ."
13884,"The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on Sunday , 26 December 2004 , with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia ."
13885,The quake itself is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake .
13886,"The resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , South Asian tsunami , Indonesian tsunami , and the Boxing Day tsunami ."
13887,"The earthquake was caused by subduction and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean , killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to high ."
13888,It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history .
13889,"Indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand ."
13890,"With a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3 , it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph ."
13891,"The earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes ."
13892,It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska .
13893,Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia .
13894,The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response .
13895,"In all , the worldwide community donated more than $ 14 billion ( 2004 US $ ) in humanitarian aid ."
13896,"The term cubic foot is an Imperial and US customary ( non- metric ) unit of volume , used in the United States and the United Kingdom ."
13897,It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot ( 0.3048 m ) in length .
13898,To calculate cubic feet multiply length X width X height .
13899,"Hồ Chí Minh ( Northern Vietnamese pronunciation : , Southern Vietnamese pronunciation : ) ; 19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969 ) , born Nguyễn Sinh Cung and also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành and Nguyễn Ái Quốc , was a Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader who was prime minister ( 1945–1955 ) and president ( 1945–1969 ) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) ."
13900,"He was a key figure in the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 , as well as the People’s Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and the Việt Cộng ( NLF or VC ) during the Vietnam War ."
13901,"He led the Việt Minh independence movement from 1941 onward , establishing the communist -ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ ."
13902,"He officially stepped down from power in 1955 due to health problems , but remained a highly visible figurehead and inspiration for those Vietnamese fighting for his cause—a united , communist Vietnam—until his death ."
13903,"After the war , Saigon , capital of the Republic of Vietnam , was renamed Hồ Chí Minh City ."
13904,"All Roads Lead Home is a feature film released on September 26 , 2008 ."
13905,"Directed by Dennis Fallon , it stars Peter Boyle , Patton Oswalt , Jason London , Vivien Cardone , Vanessa Branch , Peter Coyote , Stephen Milton , and Allan Kayser ."
13906,"The movie was filmed in and around Kansas City , Missouri ."
13907,The movie made its World Premiere January 27 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival .
13908,"The film has also recently been in several film festivals , and has received bad reviews ."
13909,Peter Boyle died before the movie 's release .
13910,It was the last movie he appeared in .
13911,Sales taxes in the United States are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services in the United States .
13912,"While no national general sales tax exists , the federal government levies several national selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods and services ."
13913,"Furthermore , forty-five states , the District of Columbia , and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the sale or lease of most goods and some services , and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods or services ."
13914,States may also delegate to local governments the authority to impose additional general or selective sales taxes .
13915,Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the applicable tax rate .
13916,Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction and range from less than 1 % to over 10 % .
13917,Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale .
13918,Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase .
13919,"Unlike the value added tax , a sales tax is imposed only once , at the retail level ."
13920,"However , in cases where items are sold at retail more than once , such as used cars , the sales tax can be charged on the same item indefinitely ."
13921,The definition of retail sales and what goods and services are taxable vary among the states .
13922,"Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods and services that are exempt from sales tax , or taxed at reduced rates ."
13923,The purchase of goods for further manufacture or for resale is uniformly exempt from sales tax .
13924,"Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery stores , prescription medications , and many agricultural supplies ."
13925,"Sales taxes , including those imposed by local governments , are generally administered at the state level ."
13926,"States imposing sales tax require retail sellers to collect tax from customers , file returns , and remit the tax to the state ."
13927,Procedural rules vary widely .
13928,Sellers generally must collect tax from in-state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate .
13929,Most states allow or require electronic remittance .
13930,"A central processing unit ( CPU ) , also referred to as a central processor unit , is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical , logical , and input/output operations of the system ."
13931,The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s .
13932,"The form , design , and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history , but their fundamental operation remains much the same ."
13933,A computer can have more than one CPU ; this is called multiprocessing .
13934,Some integrated circuits ( ICs ) can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip ; those ICs are called multi-core processors .
13935,"Two typical components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) , which performs arithmetic and logical operations , and the control unit ( CU ) , which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them , calling on the ALU when necessary ."
13936,Not all computational systems rely on a central processing unit .
13937,"An array processor or vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements , with no one unit considered the `` center '' ."
13938,"In the distributed computing model , problems are solved by a distributed interconnected set of processors ."
13939,Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours .
13940,Normal hours may be determined in several ways:
13941,"by custom ( what is considered healthy or reasonable by society ) ,"
13942,"by practices of a given trade or profession,"
13943,"by legislation,"
13944,by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives .
13945,Most nations have overtime labor laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours .
13946,"These laws may take into account other considerations than the humanitarian , such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive , or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy ."
13947,One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work .
13948,"Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law , particularly if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of labour ."
13949,Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate .
13950,"Overtime laws , attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from country to country and between different economic sectors ."
13951,Visualization of links between pages on a wiki using a force-directed layout .
13952,Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically pleasing way .
13953,"Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible , by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes , based on their relative positions , and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy ."
13954,"While graph drawing can be a difficult problem , force-directed algorithms , being physical simulations , usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity ."
13955,Purchasing power ( sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation ) is the amount of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency .
13956,"For example , if you had taken one dollar to a store in the 1950s , you would have been able to buy a greater number of items than you would today , indicating that you would have had a greater purchasing power in the 1950s ."
13957,"Currency can be either a commodity money , like gold or silver , or fiat currency , or free-floating market-valued currency like US dollars ."
13958,"As Adam Smith noted , having money gives one the ability to `` command '' others ' labor , so purchasing power to some extent is power over other people , to the extent that they are willing to trade their labor or goods for money or currency ."
13959,"If one 's monetary income stays the same , but the price level increases , the purchasing power of that income falls ."
13960,Inflation does not always imply falling purchasing power of one 's money income since it may rise faster than the price level .
13961,A higher real income means a higher purchasing power since real income refers to the income adjusted for inflation .
13962,"For a price index , its value in the base year is usually normalized to a value of 100 ."
13963,"The purchasing power of a unit of currency , say a dollar , in a given year , expressed in dollars of the base year , is 100/P , where P is the price index in that year ."
13964,"So , by definition the purchasing power of a dollar decreases as the price level rises ."
13965,"The purchasing power in today 's money of an amount C of money , t years into the future , can be computed with the formula for the present value :"
13966,where in this case i is an assumed future annual inflation rate .
13967,Education in South Korea is viewed as being crucial for success and competition is consequently very heated and fierce .
13968,A central administration oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school .
13969,"Mathematics , science , Korean , English , and social studies are generally considered to be the most important subjects ."
13970,"Normally physical education is not considered important as it is not recognised , by the generally academic elitist South Korean populace , as education and therefore many schools lack high-quality gymnasiums and varsity athletics ."
13971,"South Korea was the first country in the world to provide high-speed internet access to all primary , junior , and high schools ."
13972,"Although South Korean students often rank highly on international comparative assessments when compared to students of most Western education systems , the South Korean education system is criticised for emphasising too much upon passive learning and memorisation ."
13973,The South Korean education system is rather notably strict and overly structured as compared to its counterparts in most Western societies .
13974,"Also , the prevalence of non-school for-profit private institutes such as academies or cram-schools ( Hagwon [ 학원 ] ) , which too emphasise on passive memorisation , as opposed to conceptual understanding , in students are criticised as a major social problem ."
13975,"The My Lai Massacre ( , ; , , or ) was the Vietnam War mass murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam on March 16 , 1968 , by United States Army soldiers of `` Charlie '' Company of 1st Battalion , 20th Infantry Regiment , 11th Brigade of the Americal Division ."
13976,"Victims included women , men , children , and infants ."
13977,Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies were later found to be mutilated and many women were allegedly raped prior to the killings .
13978,"While 26 U.S. soldiers were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions at Mỹ Lai , only Second Lieutenant William Calley , a platoon leader in Charlie Company , was convicted ."
13979,"Found guilty of killing 22 villagers , he was originally given a life sentence , but only served three and a half years under house arrest ."
13980,The massacre took place in the hamlets of My Lai and My Khe of Son My village .
13981,"The event is also known as the Son My Massacre , especially in the Vietnamese state media ."
13982,The U.S. military codeword for the `` Viet Cong stronghold '' was `` Pinkville '' .
13983,The incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in 1969 .
13984,The massacre also increased domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War .
13985,Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and protect the wounded were initially denounced by several U.S . Congressmen as traitors .
13986,They received hate mail and death threats and found mutilated animals on their doorsteps .
13987,The three were later widely praised and decorated by the Army for their heroic actions .
13988,"The hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda , and 15 of the 19 were citizens of Saudi Arabia ."
13989,"Others were from Egypt , Lebanon , and the UAE ."
13990,"The hijackers were organized into four teams , each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with four `` muscle hijackers '' who were trained to help subdue the pilots , passengers , and crew ."
13991,"The first hijackers to arrive in the United States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi , who settled in the San Diego area in January 2000 ."
13992,"They were followed by three hijacker-pilots , Mohamed Atta , Marwan al-Shehhi , and Ziad Jarrah early in the summer of 2000 to undertake flight training in south Florida ."
13993,"The fourth hijacker-pilot , Hani Hanjour , arrived in San Diego in December 2000 ."
13994,"The rest of the `` muscle hijackers '' arrived in the spring and early summer of 2001 , just months before the September 11 attacks ."
13995,"This is a list of tables of the verified oldest people in the world in ordinal rank , such as oldest person or oldest man ."
13996,"In these tables , a supercentenarian is considered 'verified ' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research , such as the Gerontology Research Group ( GRG ) or Guinness World Records ."
13997,"The longest unambiguously documented human lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France ( 1875–1997 ) , who died at age 122 years , 164 days ."
13998,She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13 .
13999,"This led to news media attention in 1985 , after Calment turned 110 ."
14000,"Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment 's age , beyond any reasonable question , in the records of her native city , Arles , France ."
14001,More evidence of Calment 's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian ; her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world 's oldest people .
14002,"The longest undisputed lifespan for male supercentenarians is that of Jiroemon Kimura , who currently lives in Japan and is age as of ."
14003,"Since the death of 115-year old Dina Manfredini of the United States , on 17 December 2012 , Kimura , born 19 April 1897 , is the oldest living person in the world whose age can be documented ."
14004,He has also been the oldest living man since the death of 114-year old Walter Breuning on 14 April 2011 .
14005,"Since the death of 115-year old Koto Okubo of Japan on 12 January 2013 , the oldest living woman has been -year-old Misao Okawa , also from Japan , born on 5 March 1898 ."
14006,This is a timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement .
14007,The Civil Rights movement was a freedom struggle by African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s to gain equality .
14008,"The goals of the movement were freedom from discrimination , equal opportunity in employment , education and housing , the right to vote and equal access to public facilities ."
14009,"Heavy metal ( often referred to as metal ) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the United Kingdom and in the United States ."
14010,"With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness ."
14011,Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and machismo .
14012,"The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics , a status common throughout the history of the genre ."
14013,In the mid-1970s Judas Priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed .
14014,Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden followed in a similar vein .
14015,"Before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as `` metalheads `` or `` headbangers `` ."
14016,"During the 1980s , glam metal became a commercial force with groups like Mötley Crüe and Poison ."
14017,"Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme , aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other styles of the most extreme subgenres of metal like death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena ."
14018,"Since the mid-1990s , popular styles such as nu metal , which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop ; and metalcore , which blends extreme metal with hardcore punk , have further expanded the definition of the genre ."
14019,The far-right ( also known as the extreme right ) refers to the highest degree of rightism in right-wing politics .
14020,"Far right politics involves support of strong or complete social hierarchy in society , and supports supremacy of certain individuals or groups deemed to be innately superior or preferable who are to be more valued than those deemed to be innately inferior or undesirable ."
14021,The far right 's advocacy of supremacism is based on what its adherents perceive as innate characteristics of people that can not be changed .
14022,"This stands as a point of difference with the centre-right 's attribution of behaviours , such as laziness or decadence , as the primary sources of social inequalities ."
14023,The centre right—unlike the far right—claims that people can end their behavioural inferiority through changing their habits and choices .
14024,"The original far right , which emerged in France after the French Revolution , refused to accept the French Republic and supported a counter-revolution to restore the French monarchy and aristocracy ."
14025,"The far right is commonly associated with persons or groups who hold extreme nationalist , xenophobic , racist , religious fundamentalist or reactionary views ."
14026,The most extreme-right movements have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority .
14027,"Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury ( 5 April 1588 – 4 December 1679 ) , in some older texts Thomas Hobbs of Malmsbury , was an English philosopher , best known today for his work on political philosophy ."
14028,His 1651 book Leviathan established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of social contract theory .
14029,"Hobbes was a champion of absolutism for the sovereign , but he also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural equality of all men ; the artificial character of the political order ( which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state ) ; the view that all legitimate political power must be `` representative '' and based on the consent of the people ; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid ."
14030,He was one of the founders of modern political philosophy .
14031,"His understanding of humans as being matter and motion , obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion , remains influential ; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation , and of political communities as being based upon a `` social contract `` remains one of the major topics of political philosophy ."
14032,"In addition to political philosophy , Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields , including history , geometry , the physics of gases , theology , ethics , and general philosophy ."
14033,"Emotional intelligence ( EI ) is the ability to identify , assess , and control the emotions of oneself , of others , and of groups ."
14034,It can be divided into ability EI and trait EI .
14035,"Ability EI is usually measured using maximum performance tests and has stronger relationships with traditional intelligence , whereas trait EI is usually measured using self-report questionnaires and has stronger relationships with personality ."
14036,Criticisms have centered on whether EI is a real intelligence and whether it has incremental validity over IQ and the Big Five personality traits .
14037,Heredity is the passing of traits to offspring from its parents or ancestor .
14038,This is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism .
14039,"Through heredity , variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve ."
14040,"The study of heredity in biology is called genetics , which includes the field of epigenetics ."
14041,"For United States individual income tax , adjusted gross income ( AGI ) is total gross income minus specific reductions ."
14042,Taxable income is adjusted gross income minus allowances for personal exemptions and itemized deductions .
14043,"For most individual tax purposes , AGI is more relevant than gross income ."
14044,"Gross income is sales price of goods or property , minus cost of the property sold , plus other income ."
14045,"It includes wages , interest , dividends , business income , rental income , and all other types of income ."
14046,Adjusted gross income is gross income less deductions from a business or rental activity and 21 other specific items .
14047,Several deductions ( e.g . medical expenses and miscellaneous itemized deductions ) are limited based on a percentage of AGI .
14048,"Certain phase outs , including those of lower tax rates and itemized deductions , are based on levels of AGI ."
14049,Many states base state income tax on AGI with certain deductions .
14050,`` Lazy Eye '' is the third single from Silversun Pickups ' debut album Carnavas .
14051,"The band performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman , The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , Later With Jools Holland , and Last Call with Carson Daly ."
14052,The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero : World Tour .
14053,"An alternate version of the song , with a length of 7:27 , was played on XMU before the shorter version was played on FM and other XM channels ."
14054,This version was featured on their demo CD ( which featured early versions of four tracks ) .
14055,"A telephone prefix is the first set of digits of a telephone number ; in the North American Numbering Plan countries ( country code 1 ) , it is the first three digits of a seven-digit phone number ."
14056,In other countries both the prefix and the number may have different lengths .
14057,It shows which exchange the remaining numbers refer to .
14058,"A full telephone number is usually made up of country code ( required for international calls only ) , area code ( required for calls between telephone areas ) , prefix , and subscriber number ."
14059,Some places restrict certain prefixes to fax numbers or cell phones only ; in other places such dedicated prefixes are not used .
14060,"As telephone technology advanced , the precise significance of the prefix became blurred in many places ; 485 in London , UK , was once the GULliver exchange , but now 44207485xxxx is just considered one of many number blocks served by the CLKEN Kentish Town exchange ; 4420770703xx is another ."
14061,"Metformin ( BP , pronounced , ; originally sold as Glucophage ) is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class ."
14062,"It is the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in particular , in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function ."
14063,Its use in gestational diabetes has been limited by safety concerns .
14064,"It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome , and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor ."
14065,Metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver .
14066,Metformin is the only antidiabetic drug that has been conclusively shown to prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes .
14067,"It helps reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels , and is not associated with weight gain ."
14068,", metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines ( the other being glibenclamide ) ."
14069,"When prescribed appropriately , metformin causes few adverse effects ( the most common is gastrointestinal upset ) and is associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia ."
14070,"Lactic acidosis ( a buildup of lactate in the blood ) can be a serious concern in overdose and when it is prescribed to people with contraindications , but otherwise , there is no significant risk ."
14071,"First synthesized and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s , metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to insulin and other antidiabetic drugs ."
14072,"Interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people , and in 1957 , French physician Jean Sterne published the first clinical trial of metformin as a treatment for diabetes ."
14073,"It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1958 , Canada in 1972 , and the United States in 1995 ."

14076,"Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son , Lincoln Borglum , Mount Rushmore features sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln ."
14077,The entire memorial covers and is above sea level .
14078,The tallest mountain in the region is Harney Peak ( ) .
14079,South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region .
14080,"Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from environmentalists and Native American groups ."
14081,"They settled on the Mount Rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure ."
14082,"Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud and Buffalo Bill Cody but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus , and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain ."
14083,"After securing federal funding , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 ."
14084,"Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction ."
14085,"Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 ."
14086,"The U.S. National Park Service took control of the memorial in 1933 , while it was still under construction , and has managed the memorial to the present day ."

14127,"If , however , a statute which did not itself contain any limitation is to be governed by another which is temporary only , the former will also be temporary and dependent upon the existence of the latter ."
14128,"Before a statute becomes law in some countries , it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government , and finally published as part of a code ."
14129,"In many countries , statutes are organized in topical arrangements ( or `` codified '' ) within publications called codes , such as the United States Code ."

14171,"Dunham had one of the most successful dance careers in American and European theater of the 20th century , and directed her own dance company for many years ."
14172,She has been called the `` matriarch and queen mother of black dance '' .
14173,"During her heyday in the 1940s and 1950s , Dunham was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America and was widely popular in the United States , where the Washington Post called her `` dancer Katherine the Great '' ."
14174,"For almost thirty years she maintained the Katherine Dunham Dance Company , the only self-supported American black dance troupe at that time , and over her long career she choreographed more than ninety individual dances ."
14175,"Dunham was an innovator in African-American modern dance as well as a leader in the field of dance anthropology , or ethnochoreology ."
14176,"Sphagnum is a genus of between 1510 and 3500 species of mosses , commonly called peat moss due to its prevalence in wet habitats where it contributes to the formation of peat bogs and mires ."
14177,"Sphagnum accumulations can store water , since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells ; plants may hold from 16-26 times as much water as their dry weight depending on the species ."
14178,The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions .
14179,"Hence , as sphagnum moss grows , it can slowly spread into drier conditions , forming larger peatlands , both raised bogs and blanket bogs ."
14180,"These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants , including sedges and ericaceous shrubs , as well as orchids and carnivorous plants ."
14181,Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss 's cell walls .
14182,"In addition , bogs , like all wetlands , develop anaerobic soil conditions , which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action ."
14183,"Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations , such as calcium and magnesium , and releasing hydrogen ions ."
14184,"Under the right conditions , peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters ."
14185,"Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH , so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species ."
14186,"Individual peat moss plants consist of a main stem , with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches ."
14187,"The top of the plant , or capitulum , has compact clusters of young branches ."
14188,"Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes , named stem leaves ; the shape varies according to species ."
14189,"The leaves consist of two kinds of cells ; small , green , living cells ( chlorophyllose cells ) , and large , clear , structural , dead cells ( hyaline cells ) ."

14221,This was the first election in which all fifty of the current United States participated .
14222,A number of factors explain why the election was so close .
14223,"Kennedy gained since there was an economic recession which hurt the incumbent Republican , and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans ."
14224,"Furthermore , the new votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among Protestants ."
14225,Kennedy 's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon 's .
14226,"In the end , Nixon 's emphasis on his experience carried little weight , and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states ."

14232,Macbeth is a play written by William Shakespeare .
14233,It is considered one of his darkest and most powerful tragedies .
14234,"Set in Scotland , the play dramatizes the corroding psychological and political effects produced when its protagonist , the Scottish lord Macbeth , chooses evil as the way to fulfill his ambition for power ."
14235,"He commits regicide to become king and then furthers his moral descent with a reign of murderous terror to stay in power , eventually plunging the country into civil war ."
14236,"In the end , he loses everything that gives meaning and purpose to his life before losing his life itself ."
14237,"The play is believed to have been written between 1603 and 1607 , and is most commonly dated 1606 ."
14238,"The earliest account of a performance of what was probably Shakespeare 's play is April 1611 , when Simon Forman recorded seeing such a play at the Globe Theatre ."
14239,"It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book ."
14240,"It was most likely written during the reign of James I , who had been James VI of Scotland before he succeeded to the English throne in 1603 ."
14241,"James was a patron of Shakespeare’s acting company , and of all the plays Shakespeare wrote during James’s reign , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright’s relationship with the sovereign ."
14242,"Macbeth is Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy , and tells the story of a brave Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland ."
14243,"Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the throne for himself ."
14244,"His reign is racked with guilt and paranoia , and he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler as he is forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion ."
14245,"The bloodbath swiftly takes Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into realms of arrogance , madness , and death ."
14246,"Shakespeare 's source for the tragedy is the account of King Macbeth of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth ."
14247,"In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as `` the Scottish play `` ."
14248,"Over the course of many centuries , the play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth ."
14249,"It has been adapted to film , television , opera , novels , comic books , and other media ."

14261,Second-language acquisition or second-language learning is the process by which people learn a second language .
14262,Second-language acquisition ( often abbreviated to SLA ) also refers to the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process .
14263,"Second language refers to any language learned in addition to a person 's first language ; although the concept is named second-language acquisition , it can also incorporate the learning of third , fourth , or subsequent languages ."
14264,Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do ; it does not refer to practices in language teaching .
14265,The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics .
14266,It is broad-based and relatively new .
14267,"As well as the various branches of linguistics , second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology , cognitive psychology , and education ."
14268,"To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself , the terms second-language acquisition research , second-language studies , and second-language acquisition studies are also used ."
14269,"SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field , and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date ."
14270,"However , it does appear to have developed a great deal since the mid-1960s ."
14271,"The term acquisition was originally used to emphasize the subconscious nature of the learning process , but in recent years learning and acquisition have become largely synonymous ."
14272,"Second-language acquisition can incorporate heritage language learning , but it does not usually incorporate bilingualism ."
14273,"Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language , not the process itself , and see the term as referring to native-like fluency ."
14274,"Writers in fields such as education and psychology , however , often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of multilingualism ."
14275,"Second-language acquisition is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a foreign language ; rather , the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations.."
14276,"There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned , and many issues are still unresolved ."
14277,"There are many theories of second-language acquisition , but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers ."
14278,"Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of second-language acquisition , this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future ."

14415,"In general , carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids , and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and can not convert any carotenoids to retinal ( resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species ) ."

14608,Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate .
14609,"In humans , the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 ."
14610,Cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) and ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet and/or supplements .
14611,"The body can also synthesize vitamin D ( from cholesterol ) when sun exposure is adequate ( hence its nickname , the `` sunshine vitamin '' ) ."
14612,"Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin , it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense , as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight ."
14613,( Cats and dogs can not synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet . )
14614,"An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism , and must be obtained from their diet ."
14615,"However , as with other compounds commonly called vitamins , vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease , namely , rickets , the childhood form of osteomalacia ."
14616,"Additionally , like other compounds called vitamins , in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods , such as milk , to avoid disease due to deficiency ."
14617,"Measures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet , and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations ."
14618,"The evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but , because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight , no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine , USA , for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements ."
14619,"Accordingly , the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person 's vitamin D is from their diet , although that will rarely occur in practice ."
14620,"In the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol , which is also known as calcifediol ( INN ) , 25-hydroxycholecalciferol , or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25 ( OH ) D ; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a person 's vitamin D status ."
14621,"Part of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol , the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood , regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone ."
14622,"Calcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes , such as the proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis of cells ; calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammation ."
14623,"Beyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets , the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent ."

14722,"Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals , reptiles , birds , and other vertebrates ."
14723,"In mammals , testosterone is primarily secreted in the testicles of males and the ovaries of females , although small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands ."
14724,It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid .
14725,"In men , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle , bone mass , and the growth of body hair ."
14726,"In addition , testosterone is essential for health and well-being as well as the prevention of osteoporosis ."
14727,"On average , in adult human males , the plasma concentration of testosterone is about 7–8 times as great as the concentration in adult human females ' plasma , but as the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men ."
14728,Females also are more sensitive to the hormone .
14729,Testosterone is observed in most vertebrates .
14730,Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone .
14731,Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone .
14732,These ubiquitous steroids suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history .
14733,Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when `` natural '' but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population .
14734,It is often used in marketing research .
14735,"In this technique , the total population is divided into these groups ( or clusters ) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected ."
14736,Then the required information is collected from a simple random sample of the elements within each selected group .
14737,This may be done for every element in these groups or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups .
14738,A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy .
14739,"Assuming a fixed sample size , the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups , not between them ."

14773,Each of these is the richest professional club competition in its sport worldwide .
14774,"The best players can become cultural icons in both countries and elsewhere in the world , because the leagues enjoy a significant place in popular culture in the US and Canada ."
14775,"The NFL has 32 teams , and the others have 30 each ."
14776,The vast majority of major league teams are concentrated in the most populous metropolitan areas of the United States .
14777,"Baseball , football , hockey , and soccer have had professional leagues for over 100 years ; early leagues such as the National Association , Ohio League , and National Hockey Association formed the basis of the modern MLB , NFL and NHL respectively ."
14778,"Soccer was first professionalized in 1894 , but leagues suffered greatly from lack of sustainability and seldom lasted more than a decade ."

14784,Because EVM has the ability to combine measurements of :
14785,scope
14786,schedule
14787,"and cost,"
14788,"in a single integrated system , Earned Value Management is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems , which is an important contribution for project management ."
14789,"Early EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use ; and similarly , using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance ."
14790,More recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive predictors of project success .
14791,"Popularity of EVM has grown significantly in recent years beyond government contracting , in which sector its importance continues to rise ( e.g. , recent new DFAR rules ) , in part because EVM can also surface in and help substantiate contract disputes ."

14800,"Jamestown served as the capital of the colony for 83 years , from 1616 until 1699 ."
14801,"The settlement was located within the territory of a political entity known as Tsenacommacah , the state of the Powhatan Confederacy , with around 14,000 native inhabitants , and specifically was in part of the subdivision known as the Paspahegh tribe ."
14802,"The natives initially welcomed the colonists with dancing , feasting and tobacco ceremonies , and they provided crucial provisions and support for the survival of the colonists , who were not agriculturally inclined , although relations with the newcomers also soured fairly early on , leading to the total annihilation of the Paspahegh in warfare within 3 years ."
14803,"Within a year of Jamestown 's founding , the Virginia Company brought Polish and Dutch colonists to help improve the settlement ."
14804,"In 1619 , the first documented Africans were brought to Jamestown , though the modern conception of slavery in the future United States did not begin in Virginia until 1660 ."
14805,"When the colony was subdivided into the original eight shires of Virginia in 1634 , the town became located in the eponymous James City Shire ."
14806,"The London Company 's second settlement , Bermuda , claims to be the site of the oldest town in the English New World , as St. George 's , Bermuda was officially established ( as New London ) in 1612 , whereas James Fort , in Virginia , was not to be converted into James towne until 1619 , and further did not survive into the present day ."

14842,"Heliocentrism , or heliocentricism , is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of the Solar System ."
14843,The word comes from the Greek ( helios `` sun '' and kentron `` center '' ) .
14844,"Historically , heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism , which placed the Earth at the center ."
14845,"The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos , but Aristarchus 's heliocentrism attracted little attention until Copernicus revived and elaborated it ."
14846,"Lucio Russo , however , argues that this is a misleading impression resulting from the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era ."
14847,Using indirect evidence he argues that a heliocentric view was expounded in Hipparchus 's work on gravity .
14848,"It was not until the 16th century that a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented , by the Renaissance mathematician , astronomer , and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus of Poland , leading to the Copernican Revolution ."
14849,"In the following century , Johannes Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits , and supporting observations made using a telescope were presented by Galileo Galilei ."
14850,"With the observations of William Herschel , Friedrich Bessel , and others , astronomers realized that the sun was not the center of the universe and by the 1920s Edwin Hubble had shown that it was part of a galaxy ( the Milky Way ) that was only one of many billions ."

14863,"From left to right , the square , the cube , and the tesseract ."
14864,"The square is bounded by 1-dimensional lines , the cube by 2-dimensional areas , and the tesseract by 3-dimensional volumes ."
14865,A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen .
14866,"The same applies to the tesseract , which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space ."
14867,A diagram showing the first four spatial dimensions .
14868,"In physics and mathematics , the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it ."
14869,"Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it ( for example , the point at 5 on a number line ) ."
14870,"A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it ( for example , to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its latitude and its longitude ) ."
14871,"The inside of a cube , a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces ."
14872,"In physical terms , dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space ( volume ) and its position in time ( perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-axis ) , as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that correlate with both particle and field conceptions , interact according to relative properties of mass —and are fundamentally mathematical in description ."
14873,"These , or other axes , may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or structure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences ."
14874,"Physical theories that incorporate time , such as general relativity , are said to work in 4-dimensional `` spacetime `` , ( defined as a Minkowski space ) ."
14875,Modern theories tend to be `` higher-dimensional '' including quantum field and string theories .
14876,The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space .
14877,The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects .
14878,"High-dimensional spaces occur in mathematics and the sciences for many reasons , frequently as configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics ; these are abstract spaces , independent of the physical space we live in ."
14879,"Fontana ( ) is a city of 200,762 residents in San Bernardino County , California ."

14894,"The facility can also be used for a variety of other activities outside of its main purpose ( professional football ) such as concerts , basketball games , boxing matches , college football and high school football contests , soccer matches , and motocross races ."
14895,"Canadian historians until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history , including labour history ."
14896,In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political or military conflicts than other societies .
14897,This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant .
14898,"Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians , such as Harold Innis , Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower"
14899,"Scholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States , but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada ."
14900,The heavily Marxist influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history .
14901,"A focus on class , urban areas , and industry fails to address Canada 's rural and resource based economy ."
14902,"Similarly , the monetarist school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border ."
14903,"The study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on economic geography , and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the staples thesis ."
14904,This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of natural resources .
14905,This approach has since also become used outside of Canada in Australia and in many developing nations .
14906,"Before the arrival of Europeans , the First Nations of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network ."
14907,"Furs , tools , decorative items , and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres , mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region ."
14908,The early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the staples thesis which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe .
14909,"Carbon-14 , 14C , or radiocarbon , is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons ."
14910,"Its presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues ( 1949 ) to date archaeological , geological and hydrogeological samples ."
14911,"Carbon-14 was discovered on 27 February 1940 , by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , although its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934 ."
14912,"There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth : 99 % of the carbon is carbon-12 , 1 % is carbon-13 , and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts , i.e. , making up about 1 part per trillion ( 0.0000000001 % ) of the carbon in the atmosphere ."
14913,"The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years ."
14914,Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay .
14915,"The primary natural source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the atmosphere , and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide ."
14916,"However , open-air nuclear testing between 1955–1980 contributed to this pool ."
14917,The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties .
14918,"This is used in chemical and biological research , in a technique called carbon labeling : carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon , in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound ."
14919,Lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer
14920,Lightning strikes are electrical discharges on a massive scale between the atmosphere and an earth-bound object .
14921,"They mostly originate in thunderclouds and terminate on the ground , called Cloud to Ground ( CG ) lightning ."
14922,"However , they may also be initiated from a very tall grounded object and reach into the clouds ."
14923,"Although `` a lightning strike '' is commonly used to describe all lightning , it is rather erroneous and a misnomer , as only about 25 % of all lightning events worldwide are CG , the large bulk of lightning events are Intracloud ( IC ) or Cloud to Cloud ( CC ) , where discharge only occurs high in the atmosphere ."
14924,"The scientific name for the complete process of a single lightning event is a and it is a very complex , multiple stepped interaction , which is not completely understood ."

14932,Thunder is a physical absolute for every single flash of lightning .
14933,"Contrary to popular belief , a lightning strike itself is usually not responsible for multiple deaths or injuries from a single event ."
14934,"It would be impossible given the natural tendencies of a flash , unless people or animals were stacked on top of each other , or they were somehow arranged vertically and part of the flash channel ."
14935,"When lightning ignites an available fuel source and an explosion occurs , it is the shock wave or fire causing the injuries , not the strike itself ."
14936,"Ground Currents , also called step potential , of an earth termination is what truly causes most injuries or death to humans and animals ."
14937,"The near instantaneous rush of surface charges , induced by the overhead thundercloud itself , race to the strike point from hundreds to thousands of feet away during discharge ."
14938,"This current , caused during each stroke , takes the path of least resistance , which may be ion rich human or animal legs , over poorly conducting earth ."
14939,"This is why it is best to crouch , with feet close together , if ever caught in the open during a thunderstorm ."
14940,"Unfortunately , most reports do not draw a distinction between the real cause of injury or death , be it the strike itself , a resulting explosion or fire , or usually responsible step potential ."

15134,"Firstly , prefixes and suffixes , primarily in Greek , but also in Latin , have a droppable -o- ."
15135,"As a general rule , this -o- almost always acts as a joint-stem to connect two consonantal roots , e.g . arthr- + -o- + logy = arthrology ."
15136,"But generally , the -o- is dropped when connecting to a vowel-stem ; e.g . arthr- + itis = arthritis , instead of arthr-o-itis ."
15137,"Secondly , medical roots generally go together according to language : Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes ."
15138,"Although international scientific vocabulary is not stringent about segregating combining forms of different languages , it is advisable when coining new words not to mix different lingual roots ."
15139,"Stomach cancer , or gastric cancer , refers to cancer arising from any part of the stomach ."

15154,The Berlin blockade ( 24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949 ) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War .
15155,"During the multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany , the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies ' railway , road , and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control ."
15156,"Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city ."
15157,"In response , the Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin ."
15158,"Aircrews from the United States Air Force , the British Royal Air Force , the Royal Australian Air Force , the Royal Canadian Air Force , the Royal New Zealand Air Force , and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year , providing up to 4700 tons of daily necessities such as fuel and food to the Berliners ."
15159,"By the spring of 1949 , the effort was clearly succeeding and , by April , the airlift was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail ."
15160,The success of the Berlin Airlift brought embarrassment to the Soviets who had refused to believe it could make a difference .
15161,The blockade was lifted in May 1949 and resulted in the creation of two separate German states .
15162,The Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) split up Berlin .

15177,"Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos , the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias ."
15178,"As with other brewed herbs , yerba mate leaves are dried , chopped , and ground into a powdery mixture called yerba ."
15179,The bombilla acts as both a straw and a sieve .
15180,"The submerged end is flared , with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in , but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture ."
15181,"A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes , or spring sleeve to act as a sieve ."
15182,"`` Tea-bag '' type infusions of mate ( mate cocido ) have been on the market in Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay for many years under such trade names as `` Taragüí Vitality '' in Argentina , `` Pajarito '' and `` Kurupí '' in Paraguay , and in Brazil under the name `` Mate Leão '' ."

15250,"The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands , in the northern Pacific Ocean ."
15251,"One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain , an over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long chain of volcanoes , four of which are active , two of which are dormant , and more than 123 of which are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls ."
15252,"The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia ."
15253,"While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from nearby plate boundaries ; the classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years ."
15254,"According to this theory , the nearly 60° bend separating the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate ."
15255,"In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 million year old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."
15256,Ancient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands .
15257,"The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology , embodied in Pele , the deity of volcanoes ."
15258,"After the arrival of Europeans on the island , in 1880-1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot 's volcanics , confirming the relationship long observed by the natives ."
15259,"1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar , initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands ."
15260,"In the 1970s , a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii 's seafloor ."
15261,"The hotspot has since been tomographically imaged , showing it to be wide and up to deep , and olivine and garnet -based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately ."
15262,In its at least 85 million years of activity the hotspot has produced an estimated of rock .
15263,"The chain 's rate of drift has slowly increased over time , causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease , from 18 million years for the 76 million year old Detroit Seamount , to just under 900,000 for the one million year-old Kohala ; on the other hand , eruptive volume has increased from per year to about ."
15264,"Overall , this has caused a trend towards more active but quickly-silenced , closely spaced volcanoes—whereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other ( forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the ancient Maui Nui ) , the oldest of the Emperor seamounts are spaced as far as apart ."

15382,A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord .
15383,"Although a tenant does hold rights to real property , a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property ."
15384,Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time .
15385,"As lease is a legal estate , leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market ."
15386,"A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time , and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let ( rented ) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly ."
15387,Until the end of the lease period ( often measured in decades or centuries ; a 99 year lease is quite common ) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner .

15406,"One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required ."
15407,"The shorter , faster , safer route to the US West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy ."
15408,"During this time , ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian , then French , and then American ; the United States completed the construction ."
15409,"The canal was taken over in 1999 by the Panamanian government , as long planned ."
15410,"Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914 , to 14,702 vessels in 2008 , the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System ( PC/UMS ) tons ."
15411,"By 2008 , more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal , many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned ; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax ."

15463,It developed from the sea mile and the related geographical mile .
15464,The nautical mile remains in use by sea and air navigators worldwide because of its convenience when working with charts .
15465,"Most nautical charts use the Mercator projection whose scale varies by about a factor of six from the equator to 80° latitude , so charts covering large areas can not use a single linear scale ."
15466,"The nautical mile is nearly equal to a minute of latitude on a chart , so a distance measured with a chart divider can be roughly converted to nautical miles using the chart 's latitude scale ."

15508,A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage .
15509,"Typically , stamps are made from special paper , with a national designation and denomination ( price ) on the face , and a gum adhesive on the reverse side ."
15510,Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration .
15511,"The stamp’s shape is usually that of a small rectangle of varying proportions , though triangles or other shapes are occasionally used ."
15512,"The stamp is affixed to an envelope or other postal cover ( i.e. , packet , box , mailing cylinder ) that the customer wishes to send ."
15513,"The item is then processed by the postal system , where a postmark , sometimes known as a cancellation mark , is usually applied over the stamp and cover ; this procedure marks the stamp as used , which prevents its reuse ."
15514,The postmark indicates the date and point of origin of the mailing .
15515,The mailed item is then delivered to the address that the customer has applied to the envelope or cover .
15516,Postage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840s .
15517,"Before this time , ink and hand-stamps ( hence the word 'stamp ' ) , usually made from wood or cork , were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage ."
15518,"The first adhesive postage stamp , commonly referred to as the Penny Black , was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840 ."
15519,"The invention of the stamp was a part of the attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , which in the early 19th century was in disarray and rife with corruption ."
15520,There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp .
15521,"Before the introduction of postage stamps , mail in the UK was paid for by the recipient , a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem : the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items , and senders had no incentive to restrict the number , size , or weight of items sent , whether or not they would ultimately be paid for ."
15522,"The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner , with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced ."
15523,"Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes , post cards , lettercards , aerogrammes and wrappers , postage meters , and , more recently , specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for priority or express mailing ."
15524,"The postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials , more efficiently recovered costs for the postal service , and ultimately resulted in a better , faster postal system ."
15525,"With the conveniences stamps offered , their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries ."
15526,"Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail , but by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses . )"
15527,The same result with respect to communications by private parties occurred over the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st due to declining cost of long distance telephone communications and the development and explosive spread of electronic mailing ( `` e-mail '' via the Internet ) and bill paying systems had .
15528,"As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis , historians and collectors began to take notice ."
15529,The study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as philately .
15530,"Stamp collecting can be both a hobby and a form of historical study and reference , as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations ."

15553,This spread likely coincided with the spread of Buddhism because it is an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet of East Asian Buddhism .
15554,Li Shizhen in the Ming Dynasty described a method of making tofu in Bencao Gangmu .
15555,"Tofu has a low calorie count , relatively large amounts of protein , and little fat ."
15556,"It is high in iron and depending on the coagulant used in manufacturing , may also be high in calcium and/or magnesium ."
15557,"Bubbles ( born 1983 ) is a common chimpanzee , known for being the one-time pet of American recording artist Michael Jackson , who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s ."
15558,"The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer , whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and , among other factors , to a public perception of Jackson as an eccentric ."
15559,"During the Bad World Tour , for example , Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan , where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka ."
15560,"Bubbles was initially kept at the Jackson family 's home in Encino , Los Angeles , but was moved to Neverland Ranch in 1988 ."
15561,"There , he slept in a crib in Jackson 's bedroom , used the singer 's toilet , and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater ."
15562,"In 2003 the public learned that , like all captive chimpanzees , Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal ."
15563,"He was sent to a California animal trainer , where he was reported to have attempted suicide ."
15564,"When the trainer shut down his operation in 2004 , Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes , a sanctuary in Wauchula , Florida , where he has lived since 2005 ."

15581,Where Do We Come From ?
15582,What Are We ?
15583,Where Are We Going ?
15584,One of Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin 's most famous paintings .
15585,The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general .
15586,"It can also be expressed in different forms , such as `` Why are we here ? `` , `` What is life all about ? `` , and `` What is the purpose of existence ? ''"
15587,"It has been the subject of much philosophical , scientific , and theological speculation throughout history ."
15588,There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds .
15589,"The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence , social ties , consciousness , and happiness , and borders on many other issues , such as symbolic meaning , ontology , value , purpose , ethics , good and evil , free will , the existence of one or multiple Gods , conceptions of God , the soul , and the afterlife ."
15590,"Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe , exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how ' of life ."
15591,Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality .
15592,"An alternative , humanistic approach poses the question `` What is the meaning of my life ? ''"
15593,"The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality , or a feeling of oneness , or even a feeling of sacredness ."

15595,`` The Princess and the Pea '' ( ; literal translation : `` The Princess on the Pea '' ) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a young woman whose royal identity is established by a test of her physical sensitivity .
15596,The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8 May 1835 in Copenhagen by C.A . Reitzel .
15597,"Andersen had heard the story as a child , and it likely has its source in folk material , possibly originating from Sweden as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition ."
15598,"Neither `` The Princess and the Pea '' nor Andersen 's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics , who disliked their casual , chatty style , and their lack of morals ."
15599,In 1959 `` The Princess and the Pea '' was adapted to the musical stage in a production called Once Upon a Mattress starring Carol Burnett .
15600,German Americans ( ) are citizens of the United States who were either born in Germany or are of German ancestry .
15601,"They comprise about 50 million people , making them the largest ancestry group ahead of Irish Americans , African Americans and English Americans ."
15602,They comprise about 1/3 of the German diaspora all over the world .
15603,None of the German states had New World colonies .
15604,"Not until the 1670s did the first significant groups of German immigrants arrive in the British colonies , settling primarily in New York and Pennsylvania ."
15605,"Immigration continued in very large numbers during the 19th century , with some eight million arrivals from Germany ."
15606,"They were pulled by the attractions of land and religious freedom , and pushed out of Europe by shortages of land and religious or political oppression ."
15607,"Many arrived seeking religious or political freedom , others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe , and others simply for the chance to start fresh in the New World ."
15608,"The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land , where their intensive farming techniques would pay off ."
15609,"After 1840 , many came to cities , where `` Germania '' —German-speaking districts—soon emerged ."
15610,"German Americans established the first kindergartens in the United States , introduced the Christmas tree tradition , and originated popular American foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers ."
15611,"German American celebrations are held throughout the country , one of the most well-known being the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City , held every third Saturday in September ."
15612,"There are also major annual events in Chicago , Cincinnati , Milwaukee , Pittsburgh , St. Louis and other cities ."
15613,"Like many other immigrants that came to the United States , an overwhelming number of people of German or partial German descent have essentially become Americanized ."

15626,"Benedict XVI ( , , ; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on 16 April 1927 ) is Pope emeritus of the Catholic Church ."
15627,He served as Pope from 2005 to 2013 .
15628,"In that position , he was both the leader of the Catholic Church and Sovereign of the Vatican City State ."
15629,"Benedict was elected on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave , celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24 April 2005 , and took possession of his cathedral , the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran , on 7 May 2005 ."
15630,"Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria , Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958 ."
15631,"After a long career as an academic , serving as a professor of theology at several German universities—the last being the University of Regensburg , where he served as Vice President of the university in 1976 and 1977—he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977 , an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience ."
15632,"In 1981 , he settled in Rome when he became Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia ."
15633,"From 2002 until his election as pope , he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals , and as such , the primus inter pares among the cardinals ."
15634,"Prior to becoming pope , he was `` a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century '' as `` one of the most respected , influential and controversial members of the College of Cardinals '' ; he had an influence `` second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions '' as one of Pope John Paul II 's closest confidants ."
15635,"He was originally a liberal theologian , but adopted conservative views after 1968 ."
15636,His prolific writings defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values .
15637,"During his papacy , Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries ."
15638,"He views relativism 's denial of objective truth , and the denial of moral truths in particular , as the central problem of the 21st century ."
15639,He taught the importance of both the Catholic Church and an understanding of God 's redemptive love .
15640,Pope Benedict also revived a number of traditions including elevating the Tridentine Mass to a more prominent position .
15641,"He renewed the relationship between the Catholic Church and art , viewing the use of beauty as a path to the sacred , promoted the use of Latin , and reintroduced traditional papal garments , for which reason he was called `` the pope of aesthetics '' ."
15642,He has been described as `` the main intellectual force in the Church '' since the mid-1980s .
15643,"Several of Pope Benedict 's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him , notably Christoph Schönborn ."
15644,"On 11 February 2013 , Pope Benedict announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals , citing a `` lack of strength of mind and body '' due to his advanced age ."
15645,His resignation became effective on 28 February 2013 .

15654,"Company of ladies watching stereoscopic photographs , painting by Jacob Spoel , before 1868 ."
15655,A very early depiction of people using a stereoscope .
15656,Stereoscopy ( also called stereoscopics or 3D imaging ) is a technique for creating or enhancing the illusion of depth in an image by means of stereopsis for binocular vision .
15657,"The word stereoscopy derives from the Greek `` στερεός '' ( stereos ) , `` firm , solid '' + `` σκοπέω '' ( skopeō ) , `` to look '' , `` to see '' ."
15658,Most stereoscopic methods present two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer .
15659,These two-dimensional images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of 3D depth .
15660,"This technique is distinguished from 3D displays that display an image in three full dimensions , allowing the observer to increase information about the 3-dimensional objects being displayed by head and eye movements ."
15661,A rider on a Yamaha Waverunner XL performing a high-speed turn .
15662,A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft .
15663,"Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat , a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat , then expels it through a nozzle at the stern ."
15664,"Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton ( who developed a waterjet in 1954 ) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters ."
15665,"Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes , generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers ."
15666,"Unlike these previous waterjet developments , such as Campini 's and the Hanley Hydrojet , Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water , and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution ."
15667,"From this , the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly ."
15668,"Through further developments , it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types , and as such , waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels , including passenger ferries , rescue craft , patrol boats and offshore supply vessels ."
15669,"Jetboats are highly maneuverable , and many can , from full speed , be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length , in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop '' ."
15670,"The well known Hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is cut , the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again , causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water ."
15671,"There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats , though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application ."
15672,"Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds , up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this , the extra hull resistance generated by struts , rudders , shafts ( etc . ) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range ( up to ) ."
15673,"Also , in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds ( such as tug boats ) , the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical ."
15674,"For these reasons , the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught , maneuverability , and load flexibility are main concerns ."
15675,The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry .
15676,South Africa 's s ( approximately long ) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far .
15677,Even these German-built vessels are capable of performing `` crash stops '' .
15678,Uveitis is broadly defined as inflammation of the uvea .
15679,"The uvea consists of the middle , pigmented , vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris , ciliary body , and choroid ."
15680,Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist along with urgent treatment to control the inflammation .

15684,"The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick , co-written with novelist Diane Johnson , and starring Jack Nicholson , Shelley Duvall , Scatman Crothers , and Danny Lloyd ."
15685,The film is based on the Stephen King novel The Shining .
15686,"A writer , Jack Torrance , takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel ."
15687,"His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future , such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel ."
15688,"Soon after settling in , the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm , and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence ; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son ."
15689,"Unlike previous Kubrick films , which developed an audience gradually by building on word-of-mouth , The Shining was released as a mass-market film , opening at first in just two cities on Memorial Day , then nationwide a month later ."
15690,"Although initial response to the film was mixed , later critical assessment was more favorable and it is now viewed as a classic of the horror genre ."
15691,"Film director Martin Scorsese , writing in The Daily Beast , ranked it as one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time ."
15692,"Film critics , film students , and Kubrick 's producer , Jan Harlan , have remarked on the enormous influence the film has had on popular culture ."
15693,"The initial European release of The Shining was 25 minutes shorter than the American version , achieved by removing most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel ."
15694,Patio Cola Bottle
15695,Patio Diet Cola was a brand of diet soda introduced by Pepsi in 1963 .
15696,"It was created in response to Diet Rite Cola , which was the first diet cola on the market ."
15697,Fitness promoter Debbie Drake was Patio Diet Cola 's spokesperson .
15698,"In 1964 , Patio released orange , grape , and root beer flavors ."
15699,"This flavor line was not meant to compete with brands like Orange Crush , but rather fill out the line ."
15700,Patio sodas were available in the cold-bottle market : grocery and mom-and-pop stores .
15701,"Advertising for Patio was comparatively scarce ; at the time , bottlers were regionally franchised , and related advertising was necessarily local ."
15702,"In 1964 , Patio diet cola became Diet Pepsi ."
15703,"The newly branded diet soda was advertised alongside Pepsi with the tagline `` Pepsi either way '' , which replaced the slogan `` Dances with flavor '' ."
15704,The short life span of Patio Diet cola makes it a great addition for bottle collectors .
15705,"Most of the remaining Patio line of flavors were phased out by the early 1970s , while a few survived until the mid 70s"
15706,"Infrastructure is basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society or enterprise , or the services and facilities necessary for an economy to function ."
15707,It can be generally defined as the set of interconnected structural elements that provide framework supporting an entire structure of development .
15708,It is an important term for judging a country or region 's development .
15709,"The term typically refers to the technical structures that support a society , such as roads , bridges , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , telecommunications , and so forth , and can be defined as `` the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions . ''"
15710,"Viewed functionally , infrastructure facilitates the production of goods and services , and also the distribution of finished products to markets , as well as basic social services such as schools and hospitals ; for example , roads enable the transport of raw materials to a factory ."
15711,"In military parlance , the term refers to the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support , redeployment , and operation of military forces ."
15712,"To make it simple , infrastructure is anything that is needed everyday , an everyday item ."
15713,A graphical representation of the ideal human karyotype
15714,Mitochondrial DNA .
15715,Human genetic variation is the genetic differences both within and among populations .
15716,"There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human population ( genes ) , leading to polymorphism ."
15717,"Many genes are not polymorphic , meaning that only a single allele is present in the population : the gene is then said to be fixed ."
15718,No two humans are genetically identical .
15719,"Even monozygotic twins , who develop from one zygote , have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during development and gene copy number variation ."
15720,"Differences between individuals , even closely related individuals , are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting ."
15721,"Alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations , with populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tending to differ more ."
15722,Causes of differences between individuals include the exchange of genes during meiosis and various mutational events .
15723,There are at least two reasons why genetic variation exists between populations .
15724,Natural selection may confer an adaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele provides a competitive advantage .
15725,Alleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage .
15726,The second main cause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most mutations .
15727,Most mutations do not appear to have any selective effect one way or the other on the organism .
15728,"The main cause is genetic drift , this is the effect of random changes in the gene pool ."
15729,"In humans , founder effect and past small population size ( increasing the likelihood of genetic drift ) may have had an important influence in neutral differences between populations ."
15730,The theory that humans recently migrated out of Africa supports this .
15731,The study of human genetic variation has both evolutionary significance and medical applications .
15732,It can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one another .
15733,"For medicine , study of human genetic variation may be important because some disease-causing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic regions ."
15734,New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parents .
15735,"Apart from mutations , many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans today ."
15736,"For example , it is suspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are those that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes today ."
15737,"Tea Party protesters on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall at the Taxpayer March on Washington on September 12 , 2009 ."
15738,"The Tea Party movement is an American political movement that advocates strict adherence to the United States Constitution , reducing U.S. government spending and taxes , and reduction of the U.S. national debt and federal budget deficit ."
15739,"The movement has been called partly conservative , partly libertarian , and partly populist ."
15740,The movement has sponsored protests and supported political candidates since 2009 .
15741,"The name of the movement is derived from the Boston Tea Party of 1773 , an iconic event in American history ."
15742,Anti-tax protesters in the United States have often referred to the original Boston Tea Party for inspiration .
15743,References to the Boston Tea Party were part of Tax Day protests held throughout the 1990s and earlier .
15744,"By 2001 , a custom had developed among some conservative activists of mailing tea bags to legislators and other officials as a symbolic act ."
15745,The currencies of Puerto Rico closely follow the historic development of Puerto Rico .
15746,"As a colony of Spain and the United States , Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies ."
15747,"Following the Spanish colonization in 1502 , Puerto Rico became an important port , with its own supply of gold ."
15748,"However , as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century , the archipelago 's economy suffered ."
15749,"The Spanish Crown issued the Situado Mexicano , which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain would be sent to the island , as a way to provide economic support ."
15750,"Between 1636 and 1637 , Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp ."
15751,"Inspired by this , Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766 , becoming the first colony to print 8- real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government 's approval of subsequent issues ."
15752,"The situado was discontinued during the 19th century , creating an economic crisis , as a result of Mexico gaining its independence from Spain ."
15753,"Salvador Meléndez Bruna , the colonial governor in office , ordered the issue of provincial banknotes , creating the Puerto Rican peso ."
15754,"However , printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815 ."
15755,"During the following decades , foreign coins became the widespread currency ."
15756,"In the 1860s and 1870s , banknotes reemerged ."
15757,"On February 1 , 1890 , the Banco Español de Puerto Rico was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes ."
15758,The bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under Spanish rule .
15759,"In 1895 , a Royal Decree ordered the production of provincial peso coins ."
15760,"On August 13 , 1898 , the Spanish-American War ended with Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States ."
15761,"The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills equivalent to the United States dollar , creating the Puerto Rican dollar ."
15762,"In 1902 , the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner ."
15763,Two more series were issued until 1913 .
15764,"After Puerto Rico 's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States ' economic and monetary system , the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury ."
15765,"The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues , including commemorative banknotes , private currency , and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face ."
15766,"Pepsi ( stylized in lowercase as pepsi , formerly stylized in uppercase as PEPSI ) is a carbonated soft drink that is produced and manufactured by PepsiCo ."
15767,"Created and developed in 1893 and introduced as Brad 's Drink , it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28 , 1898 , then to Pepsi in 1961 ."
15768,"The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible , following the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah and preceding the Book of the Twelve ."
15769,( The order is somewhat different in the Christian Old Testament ) .
15770,"It derives its name from , and records the visions of , the 6th century BC priest and prophet Ezekiel ."

15782,There are over 200 different known cancers that afflict humans .
15783,Determining what causes cancer is complex .
15784,"Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer , including tobacco use , certain infections , radiation , lack of physical activity , obesity , and environmental pollutants ."
15785,These can directly damage genes or combine with existing genetic faults within cells to cause the disease .
15786,Approximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary .
15787,"Cancer can be detected in a number of ways , including the presence of certain signs and symptoms , screening tests , or medical imaging ."
15788,Once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by microscopic examination of a tissue sample .
15789,"Cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy , radiation therapy and surgery ."

15798,"John Maynard Keynes , 1st Baron Keynes , CB , FBA ( ; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946 ) was a British economist whose ideas have fundamentally affected the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics , and informed the economic policies of governments ."
15799,"He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles , and is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century ."
15800,"His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics , as well as its various offshoots ."
15801,"In many ways , subsequent developments in 20th century economics can be viewed as either building on Keynes ' ideas or reacting against them ."
15802,"In the 1930s , Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking , overturning the older ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would , in the short to medium term , automatically provide full employment , as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands ."
15803,"Keynes instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity , and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment ."
15804,He advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions .
15805,"Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Keynes 's ideas concerning economic policy were adopted by leading Western economies ."
15806,"In 1942 , Keynes was awarded a hereditary peerage as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex ."
15807,"Keynes died in 1946 , but during the 1950s and 1960s the success of Keynesian economics resulted in almost all capitalist governments adopting its policy recommendations ."
15808,"Keynes 's influence waned in the 1970s , partly as a result of problems that began to afflict the Anglo-American economies from the start of the decade , and partly because of critiques from Milton Friedman and other economists who were pessimistic about the ability of governments to regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy ."
15809,"However , the advent of the global financial crisis in 2007 caused a resurgence in Keynesian thought ."
15810,"Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the crisis by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama of the United States , Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom , and other heads of governments ."
15811,"In 1999 , Time magazine included Keynes in their list of the 100 most important and influential people of the 20th century , commenting that : `` His radical idea that governments should spend money they do n't have may have saved capitalism . ''"

15818,"According to the story in Exodus , God inscribed them on two stone tablets , which he gave to Moses on Mount Sinai ."

16232,Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question .
16233,"Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age ."

16266,"Historically , together with Shavuot ( `` Pentecost '' ) and Sukkot ( `` Tabernacles '' ) , Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals ( Shalosh Regalim ) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem ."

16269,"In Judaism , a day commences at dusk and lasts until the following dusk , thus the first day of Passover only begins after dusk of the 14th of Nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the month of Nisan ."
16270,The rituals unique to the Passover celebrations commence with the Passover Seder when the 15th of Nisan has begun .

16276,"The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and , upon seeing this , the spirit of the Lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes , hence the name of the holiday ."
16277,There is some debate over where the term is actually derived from .
16278,"When the Pharaoh freed the Israelites , it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise ( leaven ) ."
16279,"In commemoration , for the duration of Passover no leavened bread is eaten , for which reason it is called `` The Festival of the Unleavened Bread '' ."

16407,"There are numerous debates over who created the first video game , with the answer depending largely on how video games are defined ."
16408,"The evolution of video games represents a tangled web of several different industries , including scientific , computer , arcade , and consumer electronics ."
16409,The `` video '' in `` video game `` traditionally refers to a raster display device .
16410,"With the popular catch phrase use of the term `` video game '' , the term now implies all display types , formats , and platforms ."
16411,Historians have also sought to bypass the issue by instead using the more specific `` digital games '' descriptive .

16425,Data Execution Prevention ( DEP ) is a security feature included in modern operating systems .
16426,"It is known to be available in Linux , Mac OS X , iOS , Microsoft Windows and Android operating systems and is intended to prevent an application or service from executing code from a non-executable memory region ."
16427,"This helps prevent certain exploits that store code via a buffer overflow , for example ."
16428,"DEP runs in two modes : hardware-enforced DEP for CPUs that can mark memory pages as nonexecutable , and software-enforced DEP with limited protection for CPUs that do not have hardware support ."
16429,"Software-enforced DEP does not protect against execution of code in data pages , but instead counters SEH overwrite , another type of attack ."
16430,"DEP was introduced on Linux in 2004 ( kernel 2.6.8 ) , on Windows in 2004 with Windows XP Service Pack 2 , while Apple introduced DEP when they moved to x86 in 2006 ."

16436,"Early CAPTCHAs such as these , generated by the EZ-Gimpy program , were used on Yahoo !"
16437,"A modern CAPTCHA , rather than attempting to create a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text , might focus on making segmentation difficult by adding an angled line ."
16438,"Another way to make segmentation difficult is to crowd symbols together , as in Yahoo ! 's current CAPTCHA format ."
16439,Some CAPTCHAs try to utilize the ability of people to see three-dimensional objects .
16440,"On this image , symbols are drawn with lines of different thickness to make an effect of extrusion ."
16441,A CAPTCHA ( ) is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a human being .
16442,The process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete a simple test which the computer is able to grade .
16443,"These tests are designed to be easy for a computer to generate but difficult for a computer to solve , but again easy for a human ."
16444,"If a correct solution is received , it can be presumed to have been entered by a human ."
16445,A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen .
16446,"Such tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites , since a normal human can easily read a CAPTCHA , while the bot can not process the image letters and therefore , can not answer properly , or at all ."
16447,"Although most CAPTCHAs are letter pictures randomly generated , many of them have become difficult even for a human to read , so picture CAPTCHAs were created in which a human is shown a simple test to show a picture of a certain animal ( given few animal pictures ) , which is simple for a human being to process , and therefore easy to pick , while a bot can not process and solve the question because although it can analyze the picture , it can not easily guess the animal ."
16448,"The term `` CAPTCHA '' was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn , Manuel Blum , Nicholas J. Hopper , and John Langford ( all of Carnegie Mellon University ) ."
16449,It is an acronym based on the word `` capture '' and standing for `` Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart '' .
16450,"Carnegie Mellon University attempted to trademark the term on 15 October 2004 , but the trademark application was abandoned on 21 April 2008 ."
16451,"A CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test , because it is administered by a machine and targeted at a human , in contrast to the standard Turing test that is typically administered by a human and targeted at a machine ."

16458,"KFC was founded by Harland Sanders , who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin , Kentucky during the Great Depression ."
16459,"Sanders was one of the first people to see the potential of the restaurant franchising concept , with the first `` Kentucky Fried Chicken '' franchise opening in Utah in 1952 ."
16460,"The franchise popularized chicken in the fast food industry , thereby diversifying the market and challenging the dominance of the hamburger ."
16461,"Marketing himself as `` Colonel Sanders '' , he became a legendary figure of American cultural history , and his image is still prominently used in KFC branding ."
16462,"The company 's rapid expansion saw it grow too large for Sanders to manage , and in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y . Brown , Jr. and Jack Massey ."
16463,"KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally , opening outlets in England , Mexico and Puerto Rico by the mid-1960s ."
16464,"Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , KFC experienced mixed fortunes domestically , as it went through a series of corporate owners who had little or no experience in the restaurant business ."
16465,"In the early 1970s , KFC was sold to the spirits firm Heublein , who were taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate , who sold the chain to PepsiCo ."

16475,"Cnidaria ( with a silent c ) or Coelenterata is a phylum containing over 10,000 species of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environments ."
16476,"Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes , specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey ."
16477,"Their bodies consist of mesoglea , a non-living jelly-like substance , sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick ."
16478,"They have two basic body forms : swimming medusae and sessile polyps , both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes ."
16479,Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration .
16480,"Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids , or both ."
16481,Cnidarians ' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors .
16482,"Several free-swimming Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts , and some have simple eyes ."
16483,Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually .
16484,"Many have complex lifecycles with asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae , but some omit either the polyp or the medusa stage ."
16485,"Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata , but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla ."
16486,"Cnidarians are classified into four main groups : the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa ( sea anemones , corals , sea pens ) ; swimming Scyphozoa ( jellyfish ) ; Cubozoa ( box jellies ) ; and Hydrozoa , a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms , and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o ' War ."
16487,"Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa , and there is debate about whether Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are cnidarians or closer to bilaterians ( more complex animals ) ."
16488,"Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves , but many obtain much of their nutrition from endosymbiotic algae , and a few are parasites ."
16489,"Many are preyed upon by other animals including starfish , sea slugs , fish and turtles ."
16490,"Coral reefs , whose polyps are rich in endosymbiotic algae , support some of the world 's most productive ecosystems , and protect vegetation in tidal zones and on shorelines from strong currents and tides ."
16491,"While corals are almost entirely restricted to warm , shallow marine waters , other cnidarians live in the depths , in polar seas and in freshwater ."
16492,"Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about , and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before and diversified a few million years later ."
16493,Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rare .
16494,"Scientists currently think that cnidarians , ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges , and that anthozoans are the evolutionary `` aunts '' or `` sisters '' of other cnidarians , and the most closely related to bilaterians ."
16495,"Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians , although considered more `` primitive '' than bilaterians , have a wider range of genes ."

16500,"The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico , particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries ."
16501,"The Nahuatl words aztecatl ( singular ) and aztecah ( plural ) mean `` people from Aztlan `` , a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time , and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people ."
16502,"Often the term `` Aztec '' refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan ( now the location of Mexico City ) , situated on an island in Lake Texcoco , who referred to themselves as Mexica Tenochca or Cōlhuah Mexica ."
16503,"Sometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan 's two principal allied city-states , the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan , who together with the Mexica formed the Aztec Triple Alliance which controlled what is often known as `` the Aztec Empire '' ."
16504,"In other contexts , Aztec may refer to all the various city states and their peoples , who shared large parts of their ethnic history and cultural traits with the Mexica , Acolhua and Tepanecs , and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca ."
16505,In this meaning it is possible to talk about an Aztec civilization including all the particular cultural patterns common for most of the peoples inhabiting Central Mexico in the late postclassic period .
16506,"From the 13th century , the Valley of Mexico was the heart of Aztec civilization : here the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance , the city of Tenochtitlan , was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco ."
16507,"The Triple Alliance formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico , conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica ."
16508,"At its pinnacle , Aztec culture had rich and complex mythological and religious traditions , as well as reaching remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments ."
16509,"In 1521 Hernán Cortés , along with a large number of Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies , conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec Triple Alliance under the leadership of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II ."
16510,"Subsequently the Spanish founded the new settlement of Mexico City on the site of the ruined Aztec capital , from where they proceeded with the process of colonizing Central America ."
16511,"Aztec culture and history is primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the renowned Templo Mayor in Mexico City ; from indigenous bark paper codices ; from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Hernán Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo ; and especially from 16th and 17th century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language , such as the famous Florentine Codex compiled by the Franciscan monk Bernardino de Sahagún with the help of indigenous Aztec informants ."

16517,Cumulative probability of a normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1 .
16518,"In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation ( represented by the symbol sigma , σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ) , or expected value ."
16519,A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean ; high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values .
16520,"The standard deviation of a random variable , statistical population , data set , or probability distribution is the square root of its variance ."
16521,It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation .
16522,"A useful property of standard deviation is that , unlike variance , it is expressed in the same units as the data ."
16523,"Note , however , that for measurements with percentage as unit , the standard deviation will have percentage points as unit ."
16524,"In addition to expressing the variability of a population , standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions ."
16525,"For example , the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times ."
16526,The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval .
16527,"In science , researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data , and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation ."
16528,"Standard deviation is also important in finance , where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment ."
16529,"When only a sample of data from a population is available , the standard deviation of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the `` sample standard deviation '' ."
16530,"When the sample is the entire population , its unmodified standard deviation is called the `` population standard deviation '' ."

16568,"EIC phases in slowly , has a medium-length plateau , and then phases out more slowly than it phased in ."
16569,"Since the credit phases out at 21 % ( for two children and for three or more qualilfying children ) or 16 % ( for one qualifying child ) , it is always preferable to have one more dollar of actual salary or wages ( although technically , since the EIC table moves by fifty dollar increments , it 's always preferable to have an extra fifty-dollar increment of salary or wages ) ."

16789,The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum
16790,The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V .
16791,"The decree appears in three scripts : the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs , the middle portion Demotic script , and the lowest Ancient Greek ."
16792,"Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts ( with some minor differences between them ) , it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs ."
16793,"Originally displayed within a temple , the stone was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period and eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid ( Rosetta ) in the Nile Delta ."
16794,"It was rediscovered there in 1799 by a soldier , Pierre-François Bouchard , of the French expedition to Egypt ."
16795,"As the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times , the Rosetta Stone aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this hitherto untranslated ancient language ."
16796,Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars .
16797,"Meanwhile , British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801 , and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria ."
16798,"Transported to London , it has been on public display at the British Museum since 1802 ."
16799,It is the most-visited object in the British Museum .
16800,"Ever since its rediscovery , the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries , including its transfer from French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars , a long-running dispute over the relative value of Young 's and Champollion 's contributions to the decipherment , and since 2003 , demands for the stone 's return to Egypt ."
16801,Study of the decree was already under way as the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803 .
16802,"It was 20 years , however , before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822 ; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently ."
16803,"Major advances in the decoding were : recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text ( 1799 ) ; that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names ( 1802 ) ; that the hieroglyphic text did so as well , and had pervasive similarities to the demotic ( Thomas Young , 1814 ) ; and that , in addition to being used for foreign names , phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words ( Champollion , 1822–1824 ) ."
16804,"Two other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later , and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known , including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees ( the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC , and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV , ca . 218 BC ) ."
16805,"The Rosetta Stone is therefore no longer unique , but it was the essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilization ."

16812,"However , of over 175 species , only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ) , all of which come from the Phyllobates genus , which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members ."
16813,Cajeta is a Mexican confection of thickened syrup usually made of sweetened caramelised milk .
16814,"According to chef Rick Bayless , the name for cajeta came from the Spanish phrase al punto de cajeta , which means `` a liquid thickened to the point at which a spoon drawn through the liquid reveals the bottom of the pot in which it is being cooked '' ."
16815,Another hypothesis is that it takes its name from the small wooden boxes in which it was traditionally packed .
16816,"Mexican cajeta is considered a specialty of the city of Celaya in the state of Guanajuato , although it is also produced with the traditional method in several towns of the state of Jalisco , such as Mazamitla , Sayula , and Atotonilco el Alto ."
16817,"Cajeta is made by simmering goat 's milk , or occasionally a sweetened liquid , stirring frequently , until it becomes very viscous due to evaporation of water , and caramelized ."
16818,"While goat milk is the most usual base , other liquids or juices may be used ."
16819,"In Celaya , and eventually the rest of Mexico , the confection of half goat 's milk and half cow 's milk became known by the name cajeta , but elsewhere , the milk candy became known as leche quemada , dulce de leche , etc ."
16820,"It has cousins in the many Indian milk-based sweets like pera and the milk fudge burfi , and in the opera fudge of the U.S. Cajeta is eaten on its own as a sweet , as a spread or filling for breads and pastries , such as churros , and as a topping for ice cream ."
16821,Certain liquors are added to special recipes called cajeta envinada .
16822,"In addition , cajeta envinada especial is enriched with raisins , almonds , pecans or nuts ."
16823,"Often it is used as a topping for crêpes , as a sweet sauce boiled and softened down with milk to soak the crepes , resulting in a tasty dessert ."
16824,In Mexico many brands make cajeta but the most common brand is Coronado .
16825,It is also very common to place cajeta between obleas to make a traditional Mexican dessert .

16861,"The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust , fault-tolerant communication via computer networks ."
16862,"The funding of a new U.S. backbone by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s , as well as private funding for other commercial backbones , led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies , and the merger of many networks ."
16863,The commercialization of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life .
16864,", more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world 's human population —have used the services of the Internet ; approximately 100 times more people than were using it in 1995 , when it was mostly used by tech-savvy middle and upper class people in the United States and several other countries ."
16865,The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage ; each constituent network sets its own policies .

16907,"Cross-cultural psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes , including both their variability and invariance , under diverse cultural conditions ."
16908,"Through expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior , language , and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology ."
16909,"Since psychology as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America , some psychologists became concerned that constructs accepted as universal were not as invariant as previously assumed , especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying success ."
16910,"Since there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central themes , such as affect , cognition , conceptions of the self , and issues such as psychopathology , anxiety , and depression , may lack external validity when `` exported '' to other cultural contexts , cross-cultural psychology re-examines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural variance ."
16911,"Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology , cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences ( variance ) occur , rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry ."
16912,In 1972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology ( IACCP ) was established .
16913,This branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies .
16914,Cross-cultural psychology is differentiated from Cultural psychology .
16915,"The latter is the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is significantly influenced by cultural differences , meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a very limited extent ."
16916,"In contrast , cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes ."
16917,"Walter J. Lonner , writing for Eye on Psi Chi , has stated that `` cross-cultural psychology can be thought of as a type research methodology , rather than an entirely separate field within psychology ( 2000 ) . ''"

16925,"Non-binding arbitration is a type of arbitration in which the arbitrator makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute , but this determination is not binding upon them , and no enforceable arbitration award is issued ."
16926,The `` award '' is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator 's view of the respective merits of the parties cases .
16927,Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement .
16928,"The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is , on the surface , similar to that of a mediator in a mediation ."
16929,"However , the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at , the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and , if appropriate , an indication of the quantum of damages payable ."
16930,"Subsequent to a non-binding arbitration , the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts , or by way of a binding arbitration , although in practice a settlement is the most common outcome ."
16931,The award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal .
16932,Non-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the United States and Canada .
16933,"It is largely unknown in Europe , although in the United Kingdom there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a Queen 's Counsel for an opinion on the merits and likely quantum of a claim , and then to negotiate on the basis of the views expressed in that opinion ."

16966,"On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859 , is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology ."
16967,"Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life ."
16968,"For the sixth edition of 1872 , the short title was changed to The Origin of Species ."
16969,Darwin 's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection .
16970,It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution .
16971,"Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research , correspondence , and experimentation ."
16972,Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology .
16973,"There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public , but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England , while science was part of natural theology ."
16974,"Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique , unrelated to other animals ."
16975,"The political and theological implications were intensely debated , but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream ."
16976,The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication .
16977,"As Darwin was an eminent scientist , his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific , philosophical , and religious discussion ."
16978,The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H . Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism .
16979,"Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution , with a branching pattern of common descent , had occurred , but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate ."
16980,"During the `` eclipse of Darwinism `` from the 1880s to the 1930s , various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit ."
16981,"With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s , Darwin 's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory , now the unifying concept of the life sciences ."
16982,"Charles Dillon `` Casey '' Stengel ( ; July 30 , 1890 – September 29 , 1975 ) , nicknamed `` The Old Perfessor '' , was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and manager ."

16984,"Stengel was born in Kansas City , Missouri , and originally nicknamed `` Dutch '' , a common nickname at that time for Americans of German ancestry ."
16985,"After his major league career began , he acquired the nickname `` Casey '' , which originally came from the initials of his hometown ( `` K. C. '' ) , which evolved into `` Casey '' , influenced by the wide popularity of the poem Casey at the Bat ."
16986,"In the 1950s , sportswriters dubbed him with yet another nickname , `` The Old Professor '' ( or `` Perfessor '' ) , for his sharp wit and his ability to talk at length on anything baseball -related ."

16992,June ( ) is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and one of the four months with a length of 30 days .
16993,Ovid provides two etymologies for June 's name in his poem concerning the months entitled the Fasti .
16994,"The first is that the month is named after the Roman goddess Juno , wife of Jupiter and equivalent to the Greek goddess Hera ; the second is that the name comes from the Latin word iuniores , meaning `` younger ones , '' as opposed to maiores ( `` elders '' ) for which the preceding month May may be named ( Fasti VI.1–88 ) ."

17001,June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month .
17002,"According to one etymology , June is named after Juno ( Hera ) ."
17003,"Juno was the goddess of marriage and a married couple 's household , so some consider it good luck to be married in this month ."

17008,"When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents , those documents may be said to embody a written constitution ; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document , it is said to embody a codified constitution ."
17009,"Constitutions concern different levels of organizations , from sovereign states to companies and unincorporated associations ."
17010,"A treaty which establishes an international organization is also its constitution , in that it would define how that organization is constituted ."
17011,"Within states , whether sovereign or federated , a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based , the procedure in which laws are made and by whom ."
17012,"Some constitutions , especially codified constitutions , also act as limiters of state power , by establishing lines which a state 's rulers can not cross , such as fundamental rights ."

17019,Successful engineering managers typically require training and experience in business and engineering .
17020,"Technically inept managers tend to be deprived of support by their technical team , and non-commercial managers tend to lack commercial acumen to deliver in a market economy ."
17021,"Largely , engineering managers manage engineers who are driven by non-entrepreneurial thinking , thus require the necessary people skills to coach , mentor and motivate technical professionals ."
17022,Engineering professionals joining manufacturing companies sometimes become engineering managers by default after a period of time .
17023,"They are required to learn how to manage once they are on the job , though this is usually an ineffective way to develop managerial abilities ."
17024,"In an insurance policy , the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses ."
17025,"In general usage , the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses ( see below ) that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments ."
17026,Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of trivial claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of .
17027,"By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs , the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently , incurring much higher savings ."
17028,"As a result , insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles ."
17029,Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder .
17030,They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder .
17031,The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount ( subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract ) .
17032,"Depending on the policy , the deductible may apply per covered incident , or per year ."
17033,"For policies where incidences are not easy to delimit ( for example health insurance ) , the deductible is typically applied per year ."
17034,Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim .
17035,"For example , a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft , fire , natural calamities , evacuation etc ."
17036,"There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an auto , home , boat/yacht or health insurance claim ."
17037,"An invoice or bill is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer , indicating the products , quantities , and agreed prices for products or services the seller has provided the buyer ."
17038,An invoice indicates the sale transaction only .
17039,Payment terms are independent of the invoice and are negotiated by the buyer and the seller .
17040,Payment terms are usually included on the invoice .
17041,The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice .
17042,Buyer can also have a maximum number of days in which to pay for these goods and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date .
17043,"In the rental industry , an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed , so in addition to quantity , price and discount the invoicing amount is also based on duration ."
17044,"Generally each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours , days , weeks , months , etc. , being billed ."
17045,"From the point of view of a seller , an invoice is a sales invoice ."
17046,"From the point of view of a buyer , an invoice is a purchase invoice ."
17047,"The document indicates the buyer and seller , but the term invoice indicates money is owed or owing ."
17048,"In English , the context of the term invoice is usually used to clarify its meaning , such as `` We sent them an invoice '' ( they owe us money ) or `` We received an invoice from them '' ( we owe them money ) ."
17049,"The right main bronchus ( or right primary bronchus , or right principal bronchus ) is a bronchus of the respiratory system ."
17050,"It is wider , shorter , and more vertical in direction than the left ."
17051,"It is about 2.5 cm long , and enters the right lung nearly opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra ."
17052,The azygos vein arches over it from behind ; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it .
17053,About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the upper lobe of the right lung .
17054,"This is termed the eparterial branch of the bronchus , because it arises above the right pulmonary artery ."
17055,"The bronchus now passes below the artery , and is known as the hyparterial branch ; it divides into two branches for the middle and lower lobes ."
17056,"If a foreign body in the airway passes through the trachea , it will most likely enter the right main bronchus instead of the left , due to the straighter alignment of the right bronchus to the trachea ."
17057,"Squash is a racquet sport played by two ( singles ) or four players ( doubles ) in a four-walled court with a small , hollow rubber ball ."
17058,The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racquet and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court .
17059,"The game was formerly called squash racquets , a reference to the `` squashable '' soft ball used in the game ( compared with the fatter ball used in its parent game racquets or rackets ) ."

17062,Residual oil is oil found in low concentrations naturally or in exhausted oil fields .
17063,"Often mixed with water , it can not be recovered by conventional techniques ."
17064,"However , it can be recovered using carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery ( CO2 EOR ) which involves injecting carbon dioxide into the well reducing viscosity and enhancing flow of the oil ."
17065,"The technique is not new but has not been used extensively on residual oil zones , low-grade deposits of petroleum such as the 38 square miles in the Permian Basin of Texas leased by Elliott Roosevelt Jr ."
17066,The technique is limited by availability of carbon dioxide .
17067,It does not result in sequestration of the carbon dioxide but the gas is recycled as much as possible .
17068,United States reserves of residual oil are estimated to be 100 billion barrels .

17104,"At age nine , Jean moved to the United States with his family and has spent much of his life in the country ."
17105,He first received fame as a member of the acclaimed New Jersey hip hop group the Fugees .
17106,"On August 5 , 2010 , Jean filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election , although the Electoral Commission subsequently ruled him ineligible to stand as he had not met the requirement to have been resident in Haiti for five years ."
17107,"Wyclef Jean to appeal against Haiti election ruling – BBC News , Aug 22 , 2010 ."
17108,Haiti 's electoral commission said that Mr Jean was ineligible to stand as the Haitian constitution requires candidates to have lived in the country for five years prior to an election .
17109,The 40-year-old singer lives in the US .
17110,"Jean 's efforts at earthquake relief , highly publicized in 2010 throughout Haiti and the United States , were channeled through his charitable organization , Yéle Haiti ."

17112,"In law , a set-off is a statutory defense to the whole or to a portion of a plaintiff 's claim ."
17113,"It had no existence under the English common law , being created by 2 Geo . II c. 22 for the relief of insolvent debtors , although set-off was recognized in equity ."
17114,"Such a defense could be pleaded only in respect of mutual debts of a definite character , and did not apply to cases in which damages were claimed , nor to equitable claims or demands ."
17115,"By the rules of the Supreme Court ( O. XIX . r. 3 ) a defendant in an action may set off or set up any right or claim by way of counterclaim against the claims of a plaintiff , and such set-off or counterclaim has the same effect as a statement of claim in a cross-action ."
17116,"The legal defense of set-off ( above ) was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ( `` Party A '' ) who owed money to another ( `` Party B '' ) could be sent to debtors prison , despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A ."
17117,The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court .
17118,"Upon judgment , both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing ( e.g . If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105 , the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A ) ."
17119,"Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that , where a party defaults , the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished ."
17120,"In certain jurisdictions ( including the UK ) , set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company ."
17121,"This means that , for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company , mutual debts are set-off against each other , and then either the bankrupt 's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid , depending on which side owed the most ."
17122,This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu .
17123,"The alternative , where a creditor has to pay all its debts , but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get , poses the danger of 'knock-on ' insolvencies ."
17124,The right to set off is particularly important when reporting a bank 's exposures to regulatory authorities .
17125,"The situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower ( and is therefore exposed , because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the bank 's or its depositors ' money ) is thus replaced ( where the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower ) with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken ."

17142,"Beverages containing caffeine , such as coffee , tea , soft drinks , and energy drinks , enjoy great popularity ."
17143,"In North America , 90 % of adults consume caffeine daily ."
17144,Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) is that toxic doses ( over 10 grams ) are much higher than typically used doses ( less than 500 milligrams ) .
17145,"Ordinary consumption can have low health risks , even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases , including Parkinsons Disease , and certain types of cancer ."
17146,Caffeine can have both positive and negative effects on anxiety disorders .
17147,"Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine , especially during the evening hours , but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable ."
17148,"Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal , but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less ."
17149,The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women .
17150,"Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it , but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect , and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to dehydration ."
17151,"With heavy use , tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and muscle twitching , but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine ."
17152,The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical and mental dependence remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature .

17187,The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company .
17188,"The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan , for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit , as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan , which are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ) ."
17189,"Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part , causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare ."
17190,"Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double , similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers ."
17191,Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's `` The Double `` as another inspiration for the film .
17192,"The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler , with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art ."
17193,"He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000 , and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures ."

17201,These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry .
17202,"A calorimeter ( from Latin calor , meaning heat ) is an object used for calorimetry , or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity ."
17203,"Differential scanning calorimeters , isothermal microcalorimeters , titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types ."
17204,A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber .
17205,"To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B , the substances are added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures ( before the reaction started and after it has finished ) are noted ."
17206,Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction .
17207,Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives its enthalpy change of reaction .
17208,This method is used primarily in academic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry .
17209,It does not account for the heat loss through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer and container itself .
17210,"In addition , the object placed inside the calorimeter shows that the objects transferred their heat to the calorimeter and into the liquid , and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the liquid is equal to the heat given off by the metals ."
17211,A pair of green flip-flops
17212,"Flip-flops ( also called zōri , thongs , jandals , or a variety of other names throughout the world ) are a type of open-toed sandal typically worn in casual situations , such as outside or at the beach ."
17213,They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap that passes between the first and second toes and around either side of the foot .
17214,They may also be held to the foot with a single strap over the front of the foot rather than a thong .
17215,The name `` flip-flop '' originated because of the sound that is made by slapping between the sole of the foot and the floor when walking .
17216,"This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world , originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 4,000 B.C ."
17217,"The modern flip-flop descends from the Japanese zōri , which became popular after World War II when soldiers returning to the United States brought them back ."
17218,"They became popular in casual settings during the 1960s , 1990s , and 2000s , and some varieties have even found their way into more formal attire , despite criticism ."
17219,"The use of flip-flops can result in many pains and injuries , including ankle sprains and broken bones ."
17220,"Some individuals who walk for long periods report pain in the feet , ankles , and lower legs ."
17221,"The lack of support provided by flip-flops often results in over-pronation injuries , caused by the foot slipping inwards further than normal ."
17222,This can lead to flat feet and tendonitis .
17223,"Other injuries that may result are due to the footwear 's open-toed nature , such as stubbed toes , cuts , and bruises ."
17224,"Doctors recommend purchasing pricier sandals with thick-cushioned soles , as well as those that have a strap that is not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle ."
17225,"The owners of Hanjin Osaka , seen here transiting the Panama Canal in 2008 , declared general average following an explosion in the ship 's engine room on ."

17227,"In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea , crew members often have precious little time in which to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning ."
17228,"Thus , to avoid quarrelling that could waste valuable time , there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion , based upon a share or percentage , to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril ."
17229,"While general average traces its origins in ancient maritime law , still it remains part of the admiralty law of most countries ."
17230,The first codification of general average was the York Antwerp Rules of 1890 .
17231,American companies accepted it in 1949 .
17232,General average requires three elements which are clearly stated by Mr. Justice Grier in Barnard v. Adams:
17233,`` 1st .
17234,"A common danger : a danger in which vessel , cargo and crew all participate ; a danger imminent and apparently 'inevitable , ' except by voluntarily incurring the loss of a portion of the whole to save the remainder . ''"
17235,"`` 2nd . There must be a voluntary jettison , jactus , or casting away , of some portion of the joint concern for the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril , periculi imminentis evitandi causa , or , in other words , a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole . ''"
17236,`` 3rd .
17237,This attempt to avoid the imminent common peril must be successful '' .
17238,Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus .
17239,"A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations , including the timing of all doses , which may be either recommended or compulsory , depending on the country of residence ."
17240,"A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to produce active immunity to a disease , in order to prevent or reduce the effects of infection by any natural or `` wild '' pathogen ."
17241,"Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness , either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time ."
17242,"For example , tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years ."
17243,Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions .
17244,"Over the past two decades , the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed ."
17245,"Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas ( countries , subnational areas , or at-risk populations ) where a disease is common ."
17246,"For instance , yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana , is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease ."
17247,"In developing countries , vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access , the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage ."
17248,Sample vaccinations schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child 's life and uses vaccines which cost over $ 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $ 25 .
17249,"This difference is due to the lower cost of health care , the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations , and that more expensive vaccines , often for less common diseases , are not utilized ."
17250,"In 1900 , the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children ."
17251,"By the early 1950s , children routinely received four vaccines , for protection against ( diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus , polio , and smallpox ) , and as many as five shots by two years of age ."
17252,"Since the mid-1980s , many vaccines have been added to the schedule ."
17253,", the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseases ."
17254,"By two years of age , U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections , and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctor ."
17255,"The use of combination vaccine products means that , , the United Kingdom 's immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two , rather than 25 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection ."

17263,The heart of the musical celebration has been calypso ; recently soca has replaced calypso as the most celebrated type of music .
17264,"Costumes , stickfighting and limbo competitions are also important components of the festival ."
17265,Carnival as it is celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago is also celebrated in cities worldwide .
17266,"These including Toronto 's Caribana , Miami 's Miami Carnival , Houston Carifest , London 's Notting Hill Carnival as well as New York City 's Labor Day Carnival to name a few ."
17267,Carnival was created when West African slaves mimicked their French owners who where known for their lavish costumes balls .
17268,"Forbidden to partake in these festivities and confined to their quarters , slaves combined elements from their own cultures to their master 's fete ."
17269,"Hence the creation of characters such as Jab Jab or Jab Molassie ( Devils ) , Midnight Robbers , Imps , Lagahroo , Soucouyant , La Diablesse and Demons ."
17270,"With the abolition of slavery in 1838 , freed Africans took their version of Carnival to the streets through expression of drums , riddim sections like tamboo bamboo and as each new immigrant population entered Trinidad , Carnival evolved into what we know today ."

17400,Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec
17401,Demonstration of a flexible OLED device
17402,An OLED ( organic light-emitting diode ) is a light-emitting diode ( LED ) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current .
17403,This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes .
17404,"Generally , at least one of these electrodes is transparent ."
17405,"OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens , computer monitors , portable systems such as mobile phones , handheld games consoles and PDAs ."
17406,A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications .
17407,There are two main families of OLEDs : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers .
17408,"Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC , which has a slightly different mode of operation ."
17409,OLED displays can use either passive-matrix ( PMOLED ) or active-matrix addressing schemes .
17410,"Active-matrix OLEDs ( AMOLED ) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off , but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes ."
17411,An OLED display works without a backlight .
17412,"Thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) ."
17413,"In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD , whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight ."

17424,"After baking , the result is a raised semicircular comestible ."
17425,"The traditional Cornish pasty , which has Protected Geographical Indication ( PGI ) status in Europe , is filled with beef , sliced or diced potato , swede ( also known as a yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip ) and onion , seasoned with salt and pepper , and is baked ."
17426,"Today , the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall , it is regarded as the national dish , and it accounts for 6 % of the Cornish food economy ."
17427,Pasties with many different fillings are made ; some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties .
17428,"The origins of the pasty are unclear , though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction ."
17429,"The pasty is now popular world-wide due to the spread of Cornish miners , and variations can be found in Australia , the United States , Mexico and elsewhere ."

17642,"In 1915 , the new Mint Director , Robert W. Woolley , came to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years ."
17643,"He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes , quarters and half dollars , all bearing similar designs by long-time Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber , and first struck in 1892 ."
17644,"Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition , as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar ."
17645,"Weinman 's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect , and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo , whose department included the Mint , considered having Barber create his own design ."
17646,"Mint officials were successful in getting Weinman 's design into production , although it never struck very well , which may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948 ."
17647,"Nevertheless , art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins ."
17648,"Since 1986 , a modification of Weinman 's obverse design has been used for the American Silver Eagle ."

17679,Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells .
17680,"Potassium ion diffusion is a key mechanism in nerve transmission , and potassium depletion in animals , including humans , results in various cardiac dysfunctions ."
17681,"Potassium accumulates in plant cells , and thus fresh fruits and vegetables are a good dietary source of it ."
17682,"Conversely , most plants except specialist halophytes are intolerant of salt , and sodium is present in them only in low concentration ."
17683,"This resulted in potassium first being isolated from potash , the ashes of plants , giving the element its name ."
17684,"For the same reason , heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium , and agricultural fertilizers consume 95 % of global potassium chemical production ."

17806,"A modem ( modulator-demodulator ) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information , and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information ."
17807,The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data .
17808,"Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals , from light emitting diodes to radio ."
17809,The most familiar example is a voice band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channel .
17810,These signals can be transmitted over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data .
17811,"Modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time , usually expressed in bits per second ( bit/s , or bps ) , or bytes per second ( B/s ) ."
17812,"Modems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate , measured in baud ."
17813,"The baud unit denotes symbols per second , or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal ."
17814,"For example , the ITU V.21 standard used audio frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ) , to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud ."
17815,"By contrast , the original ITU V.22 standard , which was able to transmit and receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ) , handled 1,200 bit/s by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase shift keying ."

17824,Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements .
17825,Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules .
17826,"In ionic compounds , it can take a negative charge ( an anion known as a hydride and written as H− ) , or as a positively charged species H+ ."
17827,"The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species ."
17828,"The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium ( name rarely used , symbol 1H ) with a single proton and no neutrons ."
17829,"As the simplest atom known , the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use ."
17830,"For example , as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation , the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics ."
17831,"Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century , via the mixing of metals with acids ."
17832,"In 1766–81 , Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance , and that it produces water when burned , a property which later gave it its name : in Greek , hydrogen means `` water-former '' ."
17833,"Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas , and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water ."
17834,"Most hydrogen is employed near its production site , with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing ( e.g. , hydrocracking ) and ammonia production , mostly for the fertilizer market ."
17835,"Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks ."

17852,"The window frame is labelled # 5 , a spacer is indicated as # 6 , seals are shown in red ( # 7 ) , the internal reveal is on the right hand side ( # 8 ) and the exterior windowsill on the left ( # 9 )"
17853,"To reduce shear effects on the sealed unit ( a major cause of premature failure ) , manufacturers use a rule of thumb that permits a difference of 1 mm between the thickness of the panes of glass used in the unit and still maintain the warranty for the unit ."
17854,"For example , a unit may be ordered with a 4 mm pane on the exterior and a 3 mm pane on the interior ."
17855,These variations are allowed for architectural and cost reasons .
17856,Other combinations can be specified and produced but the manufacturer may reserve the right to limit the term of the warranty or refuse to warranty the unit altogether .
17857,"For ease of description the surfaces of a double paned unit are named according to the following convention : Surface # 1 ( facing outside ) , Surface # 2 ( inside of outside pane ) , Surface # 3 ( outside of inside pane ) and Surface # 4 ( inside surface of inside pane ) ."
17858,Applying the corresponding nomenclature for triple paned units results in surfaces # 1 through # 6 .

17861,Selenium is a chemical element with symbol Se and atomic number 34 .
17862,It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its periodic table column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium .
17863,"It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature , or as pure ore compounds ."
17864,"Selenium ( Greek σελήνη selene meaning `` Moon '' ) was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously-known tellurium ( named for the Earth ) ."
17865,"Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores , where it partially replaces the sulfur ."
17866,"Commercially , selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores , most often during copper production ."
17867,"Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known , but are rare ."
17868,The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments .
17869,Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells .
17870,"Uses in electronics , once important , have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices ."
17871,Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot .
17872,"Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts , but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms , including all animals ."
17873,Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase ( which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants ) .
17874,"It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes , which convert one thyroid hormone to another ."
17875,"Selenium requirements in plants differ by species , with some plants requiring relatively large amounts , and others apparently requiring none ."
17876,The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election .
17877,"It was held on Tuesday , November 4 , 2008 ."
17878,"Democrat Barack Obama , then the junior Senator from Illinois , defeated Republican John McCain , the senior Senator from Arizona ."
17879,"As the campaign progressed , the War in Iraq and outgoing Republican President George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular , and the major-party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform ."
17880,Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s .
17881,Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote .
17882,"Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history , and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century ."
17883,"This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected , having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party ."
17884,"This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S . Senators , only the third time ( after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S . Senator was elected president , and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President ( Obama and Biden ) were both sitting U.S . Senators ."
17885,This was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties ' nominees was the incumbent President or Vice President .

17889,Visualization of fragmentation and then of defragmentation
17890,"In the maintenance of file systems , defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation ."
17891,It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions ( fragments ) .
17892,It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation .
17893,"Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together , as they are often accessed in sequence ."
17894,Defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives .
17895,"The movement of the hard drive 's read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower , compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read/write heads to seek other fragments ."
17896,A service-level agreement ( SLA ) is a part of a service contract where a service is formally defined .
17897,"In practice , the term SLA is sometimes used to refer to the contracted delivery time ( of the service or performance ) ."
17898,"As an example , internet service providers will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level ( s ) of service being sold in plain language terms ."
17899,"In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures ( MTBF ) , mean time to repair or mean time to recovery ( MTTR ) ; various data rates ; throughput ; jitter ; or similar measurable details ."

17915,"Utilization management is the evaluation of the appropriateness , medical need and efficiency of health care services procedures and facilities according to established criteria or guidelines and under the provisions of an applicable health benefits plan ."
17916,Typically it includes new activities or decisions based upon the analysis of a case .
17917,"Utilization management describes proactive procedures , including discharge planning , concurrent planning , pre-certification and clinical case appeals ."
17918,"It also covers proactive processes , such as concurrent clinical reviews and peer reviews , as well as appeals introduced by the provider , payer or patient ."
17919,"As pre-certification and concurrent review of cases grew , utilization management spun out of utilization review ."
17920,"While not synonymous , health care professionals tend to use the terms as interchangeable ."
17921,The difference is utilization management is and intends to manage health care cases efficiently and cost effectively before and during health care administration .
17922,Utilization review is more considering whether health care was appropriately applied after it was administered .
17923,There are four basic techniques in utilization management:
17924,Demand Management
17925,Utilization Review
17926,Case Management
17927,Disease Management

17932,"The book takes place in Tulsa , Oklahoma , in 1965 , but it is never stated in the book ."
17933,"A film adaptation was produced in 1983 , and a little-known short-lived television series appeared in 1990 , picking up where the movie left off ."
17934,A supply chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network .
17935,"( cf . Wieland/Wallenburg , 2011 )"
17936,"A supply chain is a system of organizations , people , activities , information , and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer ."
17937,"Supply chain activities transform natural resources , raw materials , and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer ."
17938,"In sophisticated supply chain systems , used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable ."

17945,Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates .
17946,"Other animal coverings such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin , structure and chemical composition ."
17947,"The adjective cutaneous means `` of the skin '' ( from Latin cutis , skin ) ."
17948,"In mammals , the skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue , and guards the underlying muscles , bones , ligaments and internal organs ."
17949,"Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians , reptiles , and birds ."
17950,"All mammals have some hair on their skin , even marine mammals which appear to be hairless ."
17951,The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors .
17952,"For example , the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss ."
17953,"Its other functions are insulation , temperature regulation , sensation , and the production of vitamin D folates ."
17954,Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue .
17955,This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented .
17956,The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism .
17957,"In humans for example , the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick , and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as `` crows feet '' and wrinkles ."
17958,The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the thickest skin in the body .
17959,Fur is dense hair .
17960,"Primarily , fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage ."
17961,"On some animals , the skin is very hard and thick , and can be processed to create leather ."
17962,"Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection , and birds have hard feathers , all made of tough β- keratins ."
17963,Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier to passage of chemicals and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces .
17964,"For example , a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly , as the chemical diffuses through its skin ."

17993,"A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles ( accepted by members as 'spiritual principles , ' based on the approved literature ) outlining a course of action for recovery from , compulsion , or other behavioral problems ."
17994,"Originally proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) as a method of recovery from alcoholism , the Twelve Steps were first published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous : The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism in 1939 ."
17995,The method was then adapted and became the foundation of other twelve-step programs .
17996,"As summarized by the American Psychological Association , the process involves the following:"
17997,admitting that one can not control one 's addiction or compulsion ;

18010,"Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the German Army opened the Western Front by first invading Luxembourg and Belgium , then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France ."
18011,The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne .
18012,"Following the race to the sea , both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches , stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France ."
18013,This line remained essentially unchanged for most of the war .
18014,Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front .
18015,The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances .
18016,"However , a combination of entrenchments , machine gun nests , barbed wire , and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders ."
18017,"As a result , no significant advances were made ."
18018,"Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun with a combined [ estimated ] 700,000 dead , the Battle of the Somme with more than [ an estimated ] million casualties , and the Battle of Passchendaele with roughly [ an estimated ] 600,000 casualties ."
18019,"In an effort to break the deadlock , this front saw the introduction of new military technology , including poison gas , aircraft and tanks ."
18020,But it was only after the adoption of improved tactics that some degree of mobility was restored .
18021,The German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front .
18022,"Using the recently-introduced infiltration tactics , the German armies advanced nearly to the west , which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough ."
18023,"In spite of the generally stagnant nature of this front , this theater would prove decisive ."
18024,"The inexorable advance of the Allied armies during the second half of 1918 persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable , and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice ."

18067,The leader chooses to rest or exchange leads before the next section of the climb ( choice ) .
18068,The general purpose of these stops is to allow the second to ascend to the point of the lead climber while collecting the protective gear from the route in the course of the lead climber 's ascent .
18069,"At the belay station , the protective gear is collected , possibly exchanged to a new leader , and the leader of the next pitch ascends the route ."

18083,"The at sign @ is also commonly called the at symbol , ampersat , apetail or commercial at in English—and less commonly a wide range of other terms ."
18084,"The fact that there is no single word in English for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the French arobase or Spanish and Portuguese arroba—or to coin new words such as asperand , ampersat—but none of these has achieved wide currency ."
18085,"Originally an accounting and commercial invoice abbreviation meaning `` at the rate of '' ( e.g . 7 widgets @ $ 2 = $ 14 ) , it was not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters , but was on at least one 1889 model and the very successful Underwood models from the `` Underwood No . 5 '' in 1900 onward ."
18086,It is now universally included on computer keyboards .
18087,"In recent years , its meaning has grown to include the sense of being `` located at , '' `` and , '' or `` directed at '' , especially in email addresses and social media , particularly Twitter ."

18101,Their lives inside – and outside – of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team .
18102,"The Bad Girls Club is broadcast in five countries ( United States , Netherlands , Australia , Hungary , and Sweden ) ."
18103,"It has received negative reviews from critics , who believe the show promotes violence by adolescent viewers ."
18104,"Furthermore , several cast members made controversial remarks which outraged many viewers ."
18105,The format of the show has changed from early seasons .
18106,"If a `` bad girl '' breaks a rule , she is evicted from the show and , if it is early in the season , replaced by a new `` bad girl '' ."
18107,"There have been nine complete seasons of The Bad Girls Club , with the tenth season currently airing ."
18108,"The fourth season had the highest ratings in the show 's history , becoming its `` breakthrough season '' ."

18123,Mechanical repair
18124,"Maintenance , repair , and operations ( MRO ) or maintenance , repair , and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical , plumbing or electrical device should it become out of order or broken ( known as repair , unscheduled or casualty maintenance ) ."
18125,It also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order ( known as scheduled maintenance ) or prevent trouble from arising ( preventive maintenance ) .
18126,"MRO may be defined as , `` All actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function ."
18127,"The actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative , managerial , and supervision actions . ''"
18128,"MRO operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer , i.e . a service is being offered , or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase ( Guadette , 2002 ) ."
18129,In the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organisation or smaller operation .
18130,"The former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance , repair or of the product ."
18131,The latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture .
18132,The main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product .
18133,Neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant .
18134,"DeAndre Cortez Way ( born July 28 , 1990 ) , better known by his stage name Soulja Boy Tell 'Em , or simply Soulja Boy , is an American rapper , record producer , actor , and entrepreneur ."
18135,"In September 2007 , his single `` Crank That ( Soulja Boy ) `` reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 ."
18136,"The single was initially self-published on the internet , and it later became a number-one hit in the United States for seven non-consecutive weeks starting in September 2007 ."
18137,On August 17 Way was listed at # 18 on the Forbes list of Hip-Hop Cash Kings of 2010 earning $ 7 million for that year .
18138,Way has currently released three studio albums and one independent album : his debut studio album Souljaboytellem.com ( 2007 ) was certified platinum by the RIAA .
18139,"However , his next two albums , iSouljaBoyTellem ( 2008 ) and The DeAndre Way ( 2010 ) did not match the commercial success of his debut , the latter only selling 100,000 copies , despite the success of several singles across both albums , such as `` Kiss Me Thru the Phone `` and `` Turn My Swag On `` ( iSouljaBoyTellem ) and `` Pretty Boy Swag `` ( The DeAndre Way ) ."
18140,This was mainly due to negotiation problems with Interscope Records which meant a limited amount of records were made available to the public .
18141,"As of 2011 , Way has confirmed he is working on his fourth studio album , entitled USA DRE , which will be released in 2013 ."
18142,The electron transport chain in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes .
18143,"The NADH and succinate generated in the citric acid cycle are oxidized , providing energy to power ATP synthase ."
18144,Photosynthetic electron transport chain of the thylakoid membrane .
18145,An electron transport chain ( ETC ) couples electron transfer between an electron donor ( such as NADH ) and an electron acceptor ( such as O2 ) with the transfer of H+ ions ( protons ) across a membrane .
18146,The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .
18147,"Electron transport chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions , such as the oxidation of sugars ( respiration ) ."
18148,"In chloroplasts , light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH with transfer of H+ ions across chloroplast membranes ."
18149,"In mitochondria , it is the conversion of oxygen to water , NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate that are required to generate the proton gradient ."
18150,"Electron transport chains are major sites of premature electron leakage to oxygen , generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress ."
18151,"Tramadol hydrochloride ( trademarked as Conzip , Ryzolt , Ultracet , Ultram in the USA , Ralivia , Zytram XL Durella { CR-100/200 mg } in Canada or Adolonta in Spain ) is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain ."
18152,"The drug has a wide range of applications , including treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , restless legs syndrome , motor neurone disease and fibromyalgia ."
18153,It was launched and marketed as Tramal by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH in 1977 .
18154,Tramadol is a weak μ-opioid receptor agonist that also induces serotonin release and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine .
18155,"Tramadol is metabolized to O-desmethyltramadol , a significantly more potent μ-opioid agonist ."
18156,Tramadol and its major metabolite ( s ) are distinguished from other more potent opioid agonists by relative selectivity for μ-opioid receptors .

18158,"He is the former non-executive Chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in U.S. history ."
18159,"Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960 , and was its chairman until his arrest on December 11 , 2008 ."
18160,"The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street , which bypassed `` specialist '' firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers ."
18161,He employed at the firm his brother Peter as Senior Managing Director and Chief Compliance Officer ; Peter has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison .
18162,"Peter 's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm 's rules and compliance officer and attorney , and his sons Andrew and Mark ( Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father 's arrest ) ."
18163,"On December 10 , 2008 , Madoff 's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme , and quoted him as describing it as `` one big lie . ''"
18164,"The following day , FBI agents arrested Madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud ."
18165,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) had previously conducted investigations into Madoff 's business practices , but did not uncover the massive fraud ."
18166,"In March 2009 , Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars ."
18167,Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s .
18168,"However , federal investigators believe the fraud began as early as the 1970s , and those charged with recovering the missing money believe the investment operation may never have been legitimate ."
18169,"The amount missing from client accounts , including fabricated gains , was almost $ 65 billion ."
18170,The court-appointed trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $ 18 billion .

18174,Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague
18175,"Tycho Brahe ( 14 December 154624 October 1601 ) , born Tyge Ottesen Brahe , was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations ."
18176,"He was born in Scania , then part of Denmark , now part of modern-day Sweden ."
18177,Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist .
18178,"In his De nova stella ( On the new star ) of 1573 , he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm ."
18179,"His precise measurements indicated that `` new stars , '' ( stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena , and were therefore not `` atmospheric '' tailless comets as previously believed , but were above the atmosphere and moon ."
18180,"Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena , as previously thought , and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres ."
18181,"As an astronomer , Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe , the Tychonic system ."
18182,"Furthermore , he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers , working without telescopes for his observations ."
18183,"Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements , and later Stjerneborg , underground , when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady ."
18184,On the island ( on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for printing his results .
18185,"After disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597 , he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague , where he became the official imperial astronomer ."
18186,He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou .
18187,"Here , from 1600 until his death in 1601 , he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho 's astronomical data to develop Kepler 's laws of planetary motion ."
18188,"Guro District ( Guro-gu ) is a district of Seoul , South Korea , which was separated from Yeongdeungpo District on April 1 , 1980 ."
18189,"Located in the southwestern part of the city , where besides Yangcheon District and Geumcheon District Guro District has an important position as a transport link which contains railroads , land routes from the rest of Seoul to the south of the country ."
18190,The Gyeongbu and Gyeongin railway lines connect Seoul to Busan and Incheon .
18191,"In addition , Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines 1 , 2 , and 7 , and major highways intersect in Guro District ."
18192,The name Guro originates from the legend that nine ( ) old men ( Korean : ro ) enjoyed longevity in the district .
18193,A digital industrial complex is located in Guro District .
18194,"The Guro Digital Industrial Complex , which played a leading industrial role mainly with textile manufacturing , dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967 , has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex ."
18195,"This complex played a pivotal role in the economic growth of the South Korea 's development era , referred to as the `` Miracle on the Han River `` , and also contributed 10 percent of national export in the 1970s ."
18196,Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul .
18197,The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories are moving from the area and the council is developing what it terms its four zones .
18198,"An `` e-government `` system based on this hosted the international e-participation forum on February 7–9 , 2007 , with the participation of more than thirty-seven countries ."
18199,"The forum was launched with the theme `` Promoting Democracy and Regional Development '' and twenty-five mayors including André Santini ( Issy-les-Moulineaux , France ) , Kevin Foy ( Chapel Hill , US ) , Apirak Kosayothin ( Bangkok , Thailand ) , Uvais Mohamed Emthiyas ( Colombo , Sri Lanka ) , and world experts such as Dr William H. Dutton ( Director of Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford , UK ) and Dr Ari-Veiko Anttiroiko ( professor at the University of Tampere , Finland ) participated in the forum ."
18200,"The Guro Declaration , adopted during the forum , aims to set up a portal site for e-government development and to establish a concrete project in order to bridge the digital divide among the world 's cities ."
18201,This practice has been recognised for providing a new important step in the development of e-democracy .
18202,"The e-participation forum was a key factor for Guro to play the leading role in bridging the digital divide among cities , to provide I.T . enterprises located in Guro Digital Industrial Complex the opportunity to launch into the international market , to improve its image and become a global leader to concrete e-democracy ."
18203,"The international e-participation forum on February 7–9 , 2007"
18204,"A wonton ( also spelled wantan , wanton , or wuntun in transcription from Cantonese ; Mandarin : húndùn ) is a type of dumpling commonly found in a number of Chinese cuisines ."
18205,Many people were involved in the invention of radio as we now know it .
18206,"Several possible methods of wireless communication were considered , including inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground , however the method used for radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves ."
18207,"After early speculation on the subject , experimental work on the connection between electricity and magnetism began around 1820 with the work of Hans Christian Ørsted and continued with the work of André-Marie Ampère , Joseph Henry , and Michael Faraday ."
18208,These investigations culminated in the complete theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell .
18209,This theory described the theoretical basis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves .
18210,"After Maxwell 's theory was published many people experimented with wireless communication , some intentionally using Maxwell 's theory some not ."
18211,"It is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by David Edward Hughes around 1880 , although this was considered to be induction at the time ."
18212,The first systematic and unequivocal transmission of EM waves was performed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz and described in papers published in 1887 and 1890 .
18213,Hertz famously considered these results as being of little practical value .
18214,After Hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves .
18215,"Others , notably Guglielmo Marconi , were concerned with practical improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy ."
18216,Later on Reginald A. Fessenden became the first to send an audio signal by means of electromagnetic waves .
18217,"Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C , which is required for the synthesis of collagen in humans ."
18218,"The chemical name for vitamin C , ascorbic acid , is derived from the Latin name of scurvy , scorbutus , which also provides the adjective scorbutic ( `` of , characterized by or having to do with scurvy '' ) ."
18219,"Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy , followed by formation of spots on the skin , spongy gums , and bleeding from the mucous membranes ."
18220,"Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs , and a person with the ailment looks pale , feels depressed , and is partially immobilized ."
18221,"As scurvy advances , there can be open , suppurating wounds , loss of teeth , jaundice , fever , neuropathy and death ."
18222,"Scurvy was at one time common among sailors , pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored ( subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains ) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods ."
18223,"It was described by Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC–c . 380 BC ) , and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory ."
18224,"Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel , often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages ."
18225,"This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century , continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century ."
18226,"While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency , until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932 , numerous theories and treatments were proposed , often on little or no experimental data ."
18227,"This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept , an inability to reliably link different foods ( notably present in fresh citrus , watercress , and organ meat ) to scurvy ."
18228,"An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron , thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time ."
18229,"Treatment by fresh food , particularly citrus fruit , was periodically implemented , as it had been since antiquity ."
18230,"However until the 1930s , treatment was inconsistent , with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century ."
18231,"It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy , James Lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book , A Treatise of the Scurvy , though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades ."
18232,"In infants , scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow 's disease , named after Sir Thomas Barlow , a British physician who described it ."
18233,"However , Barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse ."
18234,Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller 's disease and Cheadle 's disease .
18235,Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C .
18236,"However , humans and other higher primates ( the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers ) , guinea pigs , most or all bats , and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme ( L-gulonolactone oxidase ) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet ."
18237,"Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues , with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits ( oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits ) , tomatoes , potatoes , cabbages , and green peppers ."
18238,Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe ( from ) and atomic number 26 .
18239,It is a metal in the first transition series .
18240,"It is the most common element ( by mass ) forming the planet Earth as a whole , forming much of Earth 's outer and inner core ."
18241,It is the fourth most common element in the Earth 's crust .
18242,"Iron 's very common presence in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production as a result of fusion in high-mass stars , where the production of nickel-56 ( which decays to the most common isotope of iron ) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is exothermic ."
18243,This causes radioactive nickel to become the last element to be produced before collapse of a supernova leads to the explosive events that scatter this precursor radionuclide of iron abundantly into space .
18244,"Like other group 8 elements , iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states , −2 to +6 , although +2 and +3 are the most common ."
18245,"Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments , but is reactive to oxygen and water ."
18246,"Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray , but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides , commonly known as rust ."
18247,"Unlike many other metals which form passivating oxide layers , iron oxides occupy more volume than iron metal , and thus iron oxides flake off and expose fresh surfaces for corrosion ."
18248,"Iron metal has been used since ancient times , though copper alloys , which have lower melting temperatures , were used first in history ."
18249,"Pure iron is soft ( softer than aluminium ) , but is unobtainable by smelting ."
18250,"The material is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities from the smelting process , such as carbon ."
18251,"A certain proportion of carbon ( between 0.002 % and 2.1 % ) produces steel , which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron ."
18252,"Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces , where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron , which has a high carbon content ."
18253,Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel .
18254,"Steels and low carbon iron alloys with other metals ( alloy steels ) are by far the most common metals in industrial use , due to their great range of desirable properties and the abundance of iron ."
18255,"Iron chemical compounds , which include ferrous and ferric compounds , have many uses ."
18256,"Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction , used in welding and purifying ores ."
18257,It forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens .
18258,"Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene , the first sandwich compound discovered ."
18259,"Iron plays an important role in biology , forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin ; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates ."
18260,Iron is also the metal used at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals .
18261,The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association ( BCBSA ) is a federation of 38 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United States .
18262,"Combined , they directly or indirectly provide health insurance to over 99 million Americans ."
18263,"The history of Blue Cross dates back to 1929 , while the history of Blue Shield dates to 1939 ."
18264,"The Blue Cross Association dates back to 1960 , while its Blue Shield counterpart was created in 1948 ."
18265,"The two organizations merged in 1982 , forming the current association ."
18266,"A potato chip ( known as a chip in American , Australian , New Zealand , Canadian , Singaporean , Hong Kong , South African and Jamaican English ; as a crisp in British English and Hiberno-English , and as either a chip or wafer in Indian English ) is a thin slice of potato that is deep fried or baked until crunchy ."
18267,"Potato chips are commonly served as an appetizer , side dish , or snack ."
18268,"The basic chips are cooked and salted ; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings , herbs , spices , cheeses , and artificial additives ."
18269,"`` Crisps '' , however , may also refer to many different types of savory snack products sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland , some made from potato , but may also be made from maize , tapioca or other cereals ."
18270,An example of these kinds of savory snacks is Monster Munch .
18271,Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food market in English-speaking countries and numerous other Western nations .
18272,The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US $ 16.4 billion in 2005 .
18273,This accounted for 35.5 % of the total savory snacks market in that year ( US $ 46.1 billion ) .
18274,"Henry Clay , Sr. ( April 12 , 1777 – June 29 , 1852 ) was a lawyer , politician and skilled orator who represented Kentucky in both the Senate and in the House of Representatives ."
18275,He served three different terms as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and was also Secretary of State from 1825 to 1829 .
18276,"He lost his campaigns for president in 1824 , 1832 and 1844 ."
18277,Clay was a dominant figure in both the First and Second Party systems .
18278,"As a leading war hawk in 1812 , he favored war with Britain and played a significant role in leading the nation to war in the War of 1812 ."
18279,"In 1824 he ran for president and lost , but threw his electoral votes to John Quincy Adams , who made him secretary of state as the Jacksonians denounced what they considered a `` corrupt bargain . ''"
18280,"He ran and lost again in 1832 and 1844 as the candidate of the Whig Party , which he founded and usually dominated ."
18281,"Clay was the foremost proponent of the American System , fighting for an increase in tariffs to foster industry in the United States , the use of federal funding to build and maintain infrastructure , and a strong national bank ."
18282,"He opposed the annexation of Texas , fearing it would inject the slavery issue into politics ."
18283,"Clay also opposed the Mexican-American War and the `` Manifest Destiny `` policy of Democrats , which cost him votes in the close 1844 election ."
18284,"Dubbed the `` Great Pacificator , '' Clay brokered important compromises during the Nullification Crisis and on the slavery issue ."
18285,"As part of the `` Great Triumvirate `` or `` Immortal Trio , '' along with his colleagues Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun , he was instrumental in formulating the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Compromise of 1850 ."
18286,"He was viewed as the primary representative of Western interests in this group , and was given the names `` Henry of the West '' and `` The Western Star . ''"
18287,"A plantation owner , Clay held slaves during his lifetime but freed them in his Will ."
18288,"Abraham Lincoln , the Whig leader in Illinois , was a great admirer of Clay , saying he was `` my ideal of a great man . ''"

18346,The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies .
18347,"The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament , and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised , how they were levied , or how they would be spent ."

18367,They were much smaller ( 30–75 tons ) and faster ( 35–40 knots ) .
18368,"Both types were designed to strike at larger warships with torpedoes , using relatively high speed to get close , and small size to avoid being spotted and hit by gunfire ."
18369,They were much less expensive than large warships .
18370,"PT boats were much faster , smaller , and cheaper than conventional ( displacement hull ) vessels ."

18408,A military compass that was used during World War I .
18409,A compass is a navigational instrument that shows directions in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the surface of the earth .
18410,"The frame of reference defines the four cardinal directions ( or points ) – north , south , east , and west ."
18411,Intermediate directions are also defined .
18412,"Usually , a diagram called a compass rose , which shows the directions ( with their names usually abbreviated to initials ) , is marked on the compass ."
18413,"When the compass is in use , the rose is aligned with the real directions in the frame of reference , so , for example , the `` N '' mark on the rose really points to the north ."
18414,"Frequently , in addition to the rose or sometimes instead of it , angle markings in degrees are shown on the compass ."
18415,"North corresponds to zero degrees , and the angles increase clockwise , so east is 90 degrees , south is 180 , and west is 270 ."
18416,"These numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings , which are commonly stated in this notation ."
18417,The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han Dynasty ( Since about 206 BC ) .

18480,"Negligence ( Lat . negligentia , from neglegere , to neglect , literally `` not to pick up something '' ) is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances ."
18481,"The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by carelessness , not intentional harm ."
18482,According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law ;
18483,`` The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people . ''
18484,`` those who go personally or bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision . ''
18485,Fletcher v Rylands ( [ 1866 ] LR 1 Ex 265 )
18486,"Through civil litigation , if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause their injury , they can recover damages to compensate for their harm ."
18487,"Proving a case for negligence can potentially entitle the injured plaintiff to compensation for harm to their body , property , mental well-being , financial status , or intimate relationships ."
18488,"However , because negligence cases are very fact-specific , this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury ."
18489,"Further , the law of negligence at common law is only one aspect of the law of liability ."
18490,"Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action , the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases ."

18495,"Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm , while congenital moles , or congenital nevi , are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma ."
18496,"A mole can be either subdermal ( under the skin ) or a pigmented growth on the skin , formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte ."
18497,"The high concentration of the body’s pigmenting agent , melanin , is responsible for their dark color ."
18498,Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi .
18499,"The comprehensive metabolic panel , or chemical screen , ( CMP ; CPT code 80053 ) is a panel of 14 blood tests which serves as an initial broad medical screening tool ."
18500,"The CMP provides a rough check of kidney function , liver function , and electrolyte and fluid balance , but it is far from perfect ."

18513,"Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments ."
18514,"Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material ."
18515,"Before natural gas can be used as a fuel , it must undergo processing to remove impurities , including water , to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas ."
18516,"The by-products of processing include ethane , propane , butanes , pentanes , and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons , hydrogen sulfide ( which may be converted into pure sulfur ) , carbon dioxide , water vapor , and sometimes helium and nitrogen ."

18545,"It is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in Puerto Rico ( where these sightings were first reported ) , Mexico , and the United States , especially in the latter 's Latin American communities ."
18546,"The name comes from the animal 's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock , especially goats ."
18547,Physical descriptions of the creature vary .
18548,"Eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in Puerto Rico , and have since been reported as far north as Maine , and as far south as Chile , and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and The Philippines ."
18549,"It is supposedly a heavy creature , the size of a small bear , with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail ."

18556,Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation ( ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 55 ) .
18557,"Maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of HVAC ( heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ) design engineers ."
18558,The Predicted Mean Vote ( PMV ) model stands among the most recognized thermal comfort models .
18559,It was developed using principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady state conditions .
18560,"Because the PMV model was derived from data collected in a controlled climate , it is not suitable for applications in naturally ventilated spaces which often have high levels of air movement ."
18561,This shortcoming motivated the development of a family of empirical statistical models of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated spaces known as adaptive models .
18562,"Adaptive models of thermal comfort consider occupants as dynamically interacting with their environment , and controlling their thermal comfort by means of clothing or window-opening and closing ."
18563,"This is in contrast to thermal comfort in sealed buildings , in which occupants experience the environment passively ."
18564,"Thermal comfort is affected by heat conduction , convection , radiation , and evaporative heat loss ."
18565,"Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate , thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings ."
18566,It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling hot or cold is not just dependent on air temperature alone .
18567,Thermal comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 can be freely performed with the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE-55 .

18618,Location of the Basque-language provinces within Spain and France
18619,"Basque ( endonym : , ) is the ancestral language of the Basque people , who inhabit the Basque Country , a region spanning an area in northeastern Spain and southwestern France ."
18620,"It is spoken by 27 % of Basques in all territories ( 714,136 out of 2,648,998 ) ."
18621,"Of these , 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque country and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part ."

18946,The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997 .
18947,"McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11 , 2001 , and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison ."
18948,"Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols ; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the U.S. government , and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony ."
18949,"As with other large-scale terrorist attacks , conspiracy theories dispute the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators ."
18950,"As a result of the bombing , the U.S. government passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States , as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks ."
18951,"On April 19 , 2000 , the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building , commemorating the victims of the bombing ."
18952,Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the original explosion occurred .
18953,"In American mathematics education , precalculus ( or Algebra 3 in some areas ) , is an advanced form of secondary school algebra , and a foundational mathematical discipline ."
18954,It is also called Introduction to Analysis .
18955,"In many schools , precalculus is actually two separate courses : Algebra and Trigonometry ."
18956,Precalculus prepares students for calculus the same way as pre-algebra prepares students for Algebra I .
18957,"While pre-algebra teaches students many different fundamental algebra topics , precalculus does not involve calculus , but explores topics that will be applied in calculus ."
18958,It often involves covering algebraic topics that might not have been given attention in earlier algebra courses .
18959,Some precalculus courses might differ with others in terms of content .
18960,"For example , an honors level course might spend more time on conic sections , vectors , and other topics needed for calculus , used in fields such as medicine or engineering ."
18961,"A college prepatory class might focus on topics used in business-related careers , such as matrices , or power functions ."
18962,"In detail , precalculus deals with:"

18984,"In electricity , a battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy ."
18985,"Since the invention of the first battery ( or `` voltaic pile `` ) in 1800 by Alessandro Volta and especially since the technically improved Daniell cell in 1836 , batteries have become a common power source for many household and industrial applications ."
18986,"According to a 2005 estimate , the worldwide battery industry generates US $ 48 billion in sales each year , with 6 % annual growth ."
18987,"There are two types of batteries : primary batteries ( disposable batteries ) , which are designed to be used once and discarded , and secondary batteries ( rechargeable batteries ) , which are designed to be recharged and used multiple times ."
18988,"Batteries come in many sizes , from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers ."

19001,Northern California is the northern portion of the U.S. state of California .
19002,"The San Francisco Bay Area ( which includes the cities of San Francisco , Oakland , and San Jose ) , and Sacramento ( the state capital ) as well as its metropolitan area are the main population centers ."
19003,"It also contains redwood forests , along with the Sierra Nevada including Yosemite Valley and part of Lake Tahoe , Mount Shasta ( the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington ) , and the northern half of the Central Valley , one of the world 's most productive agricultural regions ."
19004,"The area also contains one of the 11 megaregions of the United States , spanning from the San Francisco Bay Area east to the Lake Tahoe - Reno area , and from Metropolitan Fresno north to Greater Sacramento ."
19005,"Native Americans arrived in Northern California at least as early as 8,000 to 5,000 BC and perhaps even much earlier , and successive waves of arrivals led to one of the most densely populated areas of pre-Columbian North America ."
19006,"The arrival of European explorers from the early 16th to the mid-18th centuries , did not establish European settlements in Northern California ."

19009,"Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , also known as `` disseminated sclerosis '' or `` encephalomyelitis disseminata '' , is an inflammatory disease in which the fatty myelin sheaths around the axons of the brain and spinal cord are damaged , leading to demyelination and scarring as well as a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms ."
19010,"Disease onset usually occurs in young adults , and it is more common in women ."
19011,"It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000 ."
19012,MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot .
19013,MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other effectively .
19014,"Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons , which are contained within an insulating substance called myelin ."
19015,"In MS , the body 's own immune system attacks and damages the myelin ."
19016,"When myelin is lost , the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals ."
19017,"The name multiple sclerosis refers to scars ( sclerae-—better known as plaques or lesions ) particularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord , which is mainly composed of myelin ."
19018,"Although much is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease process , the cause remains unknown ."
19019,Theories include genetics or infections .
19020,Different environmental risk factors have also been found .
19021,"Almost any neurological symptom can appear with the disease , and the disease often progresses to physical and cognitive disability ."
19022,"MS takes several forms , with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks ( relapsing forms ) or accumulating over time ( progressive forms ) ."
19023,"Between attacks , symptoms may go away completely , but permanent neurological deficits often occur , especially as the disease advances ."
19024,There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis .
19025,"Treatments attempt to return function after an attack , prevent new attacks , and prevent disability ."
19026,"MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated , and many people pursue alternative treatments , despite the lack of supporting scientific study ."
19027,"The prognosis is difficult to predict ; it depends on the subtype of the disease , the individual 's disease characteristics , the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time advances ."
19028,Life expectancy of people with MS is 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population .
19029,Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System .
19030,It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined .
19031,"Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ."
19032,"Together , these four planets are sometimes referred to as the or outer planets ."
19033,"The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times , and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures ."
19034,The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter .
19035,"When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94 , making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus ."
19036,( Mars can briefly match Jupiter 's brightness at certain points in its orbit . )
19037,"Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules ."
19038,"It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other gas giants , Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface ."
19039,"Because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) ."
19040,"The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries ."
19041,"A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope ."
19042,Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere .
19043,"There are also at least 67 moons , including the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 ."
19044,"Ganymede , the largest of these moons , has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury ."
19045,"Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter ."
19046,The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto -bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007 .
19047,The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed .
19048,Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa .

19069,An Olympus EC-20 - 2x teleconverter lens attached between a camera.1 - Camera lens 2 - Teleconverter 3 - Camera body
19070,A teleconverter ( sometimes called tele extender ) is a secondary lens which is mounted between the camera and a photographic lens .
19071,Its job is to enlarge the central part of an image obtained by the objective lens .
19072,"For example , a 2× teleconverter for a 35 mm camera enlarges the central 12×18 mm part of an image to the size of 24×36 mm in the standard 35 mm film format ."
19073,"Teleconverters are typically made in 1.4× , 1.7× , 2× and 3× models , of which 1.4× and 2× are most common ."
19074,The use of a 2× teleconverter gives the effect of using a lens with twice the focal length .
19075,It also decreases the intensity of the light reaching the film by a factor of 4 ( an equivalent of doubling the focal ratio ) as well as the resolution ( by a factor of 2 ) .
19076,Illustration of a Eukaryotic cell membrane
19077,The cell membrane is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment .
19078,The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells .
19079,The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings .
19080,It consists of the lipid bilayer with embedded proteins .
19081,"Cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signaling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , glycocalyx , and intracellular cytoskeleton ."
19082,Cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .
19083,"The Late Heavy Bombardment ( commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm , or LHB ) is a hypothetical event around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ) ."
19084,"During this event a very large number of the impact craters on the Moon would have formed , and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus and Mars as well ."
19085,"( While the LHB is `` late '' in the Solar System 's accretion period when Earth and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass , it is early in Solar System history . )"
19086,"The evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples brought back by the Apollo astronauts , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time ."
19087,"While many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of asteroids or comets in the inner Solar System at this time , no consensus yet exists as to its cause ."
19088,"The Nice model , popular among planetary scientists , postulates that the gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the terrestrial planets ."
19089,"Nevertheless , some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga , and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected by a single large impact basin ."

19091,"The Federal Reserve System ( also known as the Federal Reserve , and informally as the Fed ) is the central banking system of the United States ."
19092,"It was created on December 23 , 1913 , with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act , largely in response to a series of financial panics , particularly a severe panic in 1907 ."
19093,"Over time , the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved ."
19094,Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system .
19095,"The US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act : Maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long-term interest rates ."
19096,The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve 's dual mandate .
19097,"Its duties have expanded over the years , and today , according to official Federal Reserve documentation , include conducting the nation 's monetary policy , supervising and regulating banking institutions , maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign official institutions ."
19098,"The Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications , such as the Beige Book ."
19099,"The Federal Reserve System 's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors ( or Federal Reserve Board ) , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation , numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory councils ."
19100,"The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time ( the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms ) ."
19101,"The Federal Reserve System has both private and public components , and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankers ."
19102,The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks .
19103,"It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank , namely the United States Department of the Treasury , creates the currency used ."
19104,"According to the Board of Governors , the Federal Reserve System `` is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms . ''"
19105,The authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted by the U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight .
19106,"The members of the Board of Governors , including its chairman and vice-chairman , are chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate ."
19107,The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system 's highest-level employees .
19108,Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region ; this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the regional Federal Reserve Bank .
19109,Thus the Federal Reserve system has both public and private aspects .
19110,"The U.S. Government receives all of the system 's annual profits , after a statutory dividend of 6 % on member banks ' capital investment is paid , and an account surplus is maintained ."
19111,"In 2010 , the Federal Reserve made a profit of $ 82 billion and transferred $ 79 billion to the U.S. Treasury ."
19112,This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of $ 77 billion in profits to the U.S. Treasury Department .
19113,"Thick , unblended foundation on skin"
19114,"Foundation is a skin coloured cosmetic applied to the face to create an even , uniform colour to the complexion , to cover flaws , and , sometimes , to change the natural skintone ."
19115,Foundation applied to the body is generally referred to as `` body painting `` it is also rising in popularity with males .
19116,"Abraham Lincoln ( February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was the 16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 ."
19117,"Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional , military , and moral crises—the American Civil War —preserving the Union , abolishing slavery , strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy ."
19118,"Reared in a poor family on the western frontier , Lincoln was self-educated , and became a country lawyer , a Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator during the 1830s , and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1840s ."
19119,"After a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery , Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival , Stephen A. Douglas ."
19120,"Lincoln , a moderate from a swing state , secured the Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860 ."
19121,"With almost no support in the South , Lincoln swept the North and was elected president in 1860 ."
19122,His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederacy .
19123,"The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln 's party firm control of Congress , but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found ."
19124,"Lincoln explained in his second inaugural address : `` Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . ''"
19125,"When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12 , 1861 , Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort ."
19126,His goal was now to reunite the nation .
19127,"As the South was in a state of insurrection , Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend habeas corpus , arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial ."
19128,Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the Trent affair in late 1861 .
19129,"His efforts toward the abolition of slavery include issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery , and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which finally freed all slaves nationwide in December 1865 ."
19130,"Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including commanding general Ulysses S. Grant ."
19131,Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate .
19132,"Under Lincoln 's leadership , the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , took control of the border slave states at the start of the war , gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems , and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia ."
19133,"Each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865 ."
19134,"An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election ."
19135,"As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party , Lincoln found his policies and personality were `` blasted from all sides '' : Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats desired more compromise , Copperheads despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death ."
19136,"Politically , Lincoln fought back with patronage , by pitting his opponents against each other , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory ."
19137,His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history .
19138,"It was an iconic statement of America 's dedication to the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy ."
19139,"At the close of the war , Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness ."
19140,"Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , however , Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth ."
19141,Lincoln 's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into mourning .
19142,Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents .
19143,"Mark Cuban ( born July 31 , 1958 ) is an American businessman , investor , and philanthropist ."

19147,"The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is a single-seat , twin-engine fifth-generation supermaneuverable fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology ."
19148,"It was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter , but has additional capabilities that include ground attack , electronic warfare , and signals intelligence roles ."
19149,"Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and is responsible for the majority of the airframe , weapon systems and final assembly of the F-22 ."
19150,"Program partner Boeing Defense , Space & Security provides the wings , aft fuselage , avionics integration , and training systems ."
19151,The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 during the years prior to formally entering USAF service in December 2005 as the F-22A .
19152,"Despite a protracted and costly development period , the United States Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component of U.S. tactical air power , and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter ."
19153,"Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor 's combination of stealth , speed , agility , precision and situational awareness , combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities , makes it the best overall fighter in the world today ."
19154,"Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , former Chief of the Australian Defence Force , said in 2004 that the `` F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built . ''"
19155,"The high cost of the aircraft , a lack of clear air-to-air combat missions because of delays in the Russian and Chinese fifth-generation fighter programs , a U.S. ban on Raptor exports , and the ongoing development of the planned cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in calls to end F-22 production ."
19156,"In April 2009 , the U.S. Department of Defense proposed to cease placing new orders , subject to Congressional approval , for a final procurement tally of 187 operational aircraft ."
19157,The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 lacked funding for further F-22 production .
19158,The final F-22 rolled off the assembly line on 13 December 2011 during a ceremony at Dobbins Air Reserve Base .
19159,Since 2010 the F-22 has been plagued by unresolved problems with its pilot oxygen systems which contributed to one crash and death of a pilot .
19160,"In 2011 the fleet was grounded for four months before resuming flight operations , but reports of oxygen systems issues have continued ."
19161,"In July 2012 , the Air Force announced that the hypoxia-like symptoms experienced were caused by a faulty valve in the pilots ' pressure vest ; the valve was replaced and changes to the filtration system were also made ."
19162,"Toledo Zoo is a zoo located in Toledo , Ohio ."
19163,The zoo began in 1900 as Toledo Zoological Gardens and operated by the City of Toledo 's Parks Board .

19170,"This document , which could be over 150 pages long , is used to secure financing for the film and lead to pre-production and production of the film ."
19171,Multiple drafts of the budget may be required to whittle down costs .
19172,"A budget is typically divided into four sections : above the line ( creative talent ) , below the line ( direct production costs ) , post-production ( editing , visual effects , etc . ) , and other ( insurance , completion bond , etc . ) ."

19174,Diagnosis-related group ( DRG ) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups .
19175,The 467th group was `` Ungroupable '' .
19176,"This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter , PhD , of the Yale School of Management , and John D Thompson , MPH , of the Yale School of Public Health ."
19177,"The system is also referred to as `` the DRGs '' , and its intent was to identify the `` products '' that a hospital provides ."
19178,One example of a `` product '' is an appendectomy .
19179,"The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement , to replace `` cost based '' reimbursement that had been used up to that point ."
19180,"DRGs are assigned by a `` grouper '' program based on ICD ( International Classification of Diseases ) diagnoses , procedures , age , sex , discharge status , and the presence of complications or comorbidities ."
19181,"DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each `` product '' , since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources ."
19182,DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories ( MDCs ) .
19183,DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers .

19185,The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth 's oceanic divisions .
19186,"It extends from the Arctic in the north to the Southern Ocean ( or , depending on definition , to Antarctica ) in the south , bounded by Asia and Australia in the west , and the Americas in the east ."
19187,"At 165.25 million square kilometres ( 63.8 million square miles ) in area , this largest division of the World Ocean – and , in turn , the hydrosphere – covers about 46 % of the Earth 's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area , making it larger than all of the Earth 's land area combined ."
19188,"The equator subdivides it into the North Pacific Ocean and South Pacific Ocean , with two exceptions : the Galápagos and Gilbert Islands , while straddling the equator , are deemed wholly within the South Pacific ."

19190,The eastern Pacific Ocean was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and discovered the great `` southern sea '' which he named Mar del Sur .
19191,"The ocean 's current name was bestowed by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation in 1521 , who encountered favourable winds as he reached the ocean and called it Mar Pacifico in Portuguese , meaning `` peaceful sea '' ."
19192,The plus-minus sign ( ) is a mathematical symbol commonly used either
19193,"to indicate the precision of an approximation , or"
19194,to indicate a value that can be of either sign .
19195,The sign is normally pronounced `` plus or minus '' .
19196,"In experimental sciences , the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement , often the standard deviation or standard error ."
19197,The sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have .
19198,"In mathematics , it may indicate two possible values : one positive , and one negative ."
19199,"It is commonly used in indicating a range of values , such as in mathematical statements ."
19200,"Judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) is a motion made by a party , during trial , claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case ."
19201,"JMOL is also known as a directed verdict , which it has replaced in American Federal courts ."
19202,"JMOL is similar to judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment , all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim ."
19203,Judgment on the pleadings is a motion made after pleading and before discovery ; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial ; JMOL occurs during trial .
19204,"In United States federal courts , JMOL is a creation of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 50 ."
19205,JMOL is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the JMOL motion .
19206,"If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party , judgment is entered by the court and the case is over ."
19207,"If there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party , but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion , the party with the burden of persuasion fails ."
19208,Timing is very important in making a motion for JMOL ; the motion can only be made once the opposing party has presented its case .
19209,"In civil cases , the plaintiff presents her case , then the defendant presents his/her case , then the plaintiff may present a rebuttal ."
19210,"So , once the plaintiff has presented his/her case , the defendant may move for JMOL , but the plaintiff may not ."
19211,"Once the defendant has finished presenting his/her case , the plaintiff may move for JMOL , and so may the defendant ."
19212,"JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned , where they are called `` renewed '' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( RJMOL ) , but the motion is still commonly known by its former name , judgment notwithstanding verdict , or j.n.o.v . ( from the English judgment and the Latin non obstante veredicto ) ."
19213,"However , in order to move for j.n.o.v. , the movant must have moved for a JMOL before the verdict as well ."
19214,This procedural quirk is necessary because it is considered a violation of the 7th amendment for a judge to overturn a jury verdict .
19215,"Instead , the judge is said in a j.n.o.v . to be reexamining not the verdict , but his previous rejection of JMOL ."
19216,Christianity ( from the and the Latin suffix -itas ) is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as presented in canonical gospels and other New Testament writings as well as the Old Testament .
19217,"Most adherents of the Christian faith , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Son of God , fully divine and fully human and the savior of humanity prophesied in the Old Testament ."
19218,"Consequentially , Christians commonly refer to Jesus as Christ or Messiah ."
19219,The foundation of Christian theology is expressed in the early ecumenical creeds which contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith .
19220,"These professions state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , and was subsequently resurrected from the dead in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust him for the remission of their sins ."
19221,They further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven where he rules and reigns with God the Father .
19222,"Most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge all humans , living and dead , and grant eternal life to his followers ."
19223,"He is considered the model of a virtuous life , and his ministry , crucifixion , and resurrection are often referred to as the gospel , meaning `` Good News `` ( from the ) ."
19224,Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century .
19225,"Originating in the Levant region of the Middle East , it quickly spread to Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor and Egypt ."
19226,"It grew in size and influence over a few centuries , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire , replacing other forms of religion practiced under Roman rule ."
19227,"During the Middle Ages , most of the remainder of Europe was Christianized , with Christians also being a sometimes large religious minority in the Middle East , North Africa , Ethiopia and parts of India ."
19228,"Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization ."
19229,Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .
19230,"Worldwide , the three largest groups of Christianity are the Roman Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church , and the various denominations of Protestantism ."
19231,"The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox patriarchates split from one another in the schism of the 11th century , and Protestantism came into existence during the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Roman Catholic Church ."
19232,"As of the early 21st century , Christianity is the world 's largest religion , with approximately 2.2 billion adherents ."

19236,"Dry drowning occurs when a person 's lungs become unable to extract oxygen from the air , due primarily to:"
19237,Muscular paralysis
19238,Puncture wound to the torso ( affecting ability of diaphragm to create respiratory movement )
19239,Changes to the oxygen-absorbing tissues
19240,Persistence of laryngospasm when immersed in fluid
19241,Prolonged exposure to a gas that displaces oxygen from the lungs ( e.g . methane )
19242,Overdose of solute free water which leads to hyponatremia and swelling in the brain
19243,Holding one 's breath ( Apnea )
19244,The person may effectively drown without any sort of liquid .
19245,"In cases of dry drowning in which the victim was immersed , very little fluid is aspirated into the lungs ."
19246,The laryngospasm reflex essentially causes asphyxiation and neurogenic pulmonary edema ( œdema ) .
19247,"Dry drowning can occur clinically , or due to illness or accident ."
19248,It is also one of the effects of waterboarding .

19252,"Denver and Aurora are the principal cities of the Denver Metropolitan Area , which in 2007 had an estimated population of 2,464,866 ( the 22nd most populous MSA in the U.S. ) ."
19253,"However , Denver and Aurora combined make up less than half of the Metro Denver Area 's population and Aurora has approximately half the population of Denver ."
19254,"The estimated population of Metropolitan Denver was 2,998,878 in 2007 ( 15th most populous CSA ) ."
19255,"Holly Ridge is a town in Onslow County , North Carolina , United States ."

19258,"Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to see color , or perceive color differences , under normal lighting conditions ."
19259,Color blindness affects a significant percentage of the population .
19260,There is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color vision .
19261,The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve .
19262,This type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition .
19263,"The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome ; if some of these genes are missing or damaged , color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome ( in females , a functional gene on only one of the two X chromosomes is sufficient to yield the needed photopigments ) ."
19264,"Color blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye , the optic nerve , or parts of the brain ."
19265,"For example , people with achromatopsia suffer from a completely different disorder , but are nevertheless unable to see colors ."
19266,"The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours '' , after the realization of his own color blindness ."
19267,"Because of Dalton 's work , the general condition has been called daltonism , although in English this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone ."
19268,"Color blindness is usually classified as a mild disability , however there are occasional circumstances where it can give an advantage ."
19269,Some studies conclude that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages .
19270,Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high prevalence of red–green color blindness .
19271,And there is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish .

19277,"The history of slavery covers slave systems in historical perspective in which one human being is legally the property of another , can be bought or sold , is not allowed to escape and must work for the owner without any choice involved ."
19278,"As Drescher ( 2009 ) argues , `` The most crucial and frequently utilized aspect of the condition is a communally recognized right by some individuals to possess , buy , sell , discipline , transport , liberate , or otherwise dispose of the bodies and behavior of other individuals . ''"
19279,An integral element is that children of a slave mother automatically become slaves .
19280,"It does not include historical forced labor by prisoners , labor camps , or other forms of unfree labor in which laborers are not considered property ."
19281,"Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records , such as the Code of Hammurabi ( c. 1760 BC ) , which refers to it as an established institution ."
19282,Slavery is rare among hunter-gatherer populations as slavery depends on a system of social stratification .
19283,Slavery typically also requires a shortage of labor and a surplus of land to be viable .
19284,David P. Forsythe wrote : `` The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom . ''
19285,Slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world .
19286,Mauritania abolished it in law in 1981 and was the last country to do so – see Abolition of slavery timeline .

19434,The ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1 .
19435,T4 is converted to the active T3 ( three to four times more potent than T4 ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5'-iodinase ) .
19436,These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T1a ) and thyronamine ( T0a ) .
19437,"All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production ."

19671,It was a sensational moment of 19th century science and dramatic confirmation of Newtonian gravitational theory .
19672,"In François Arago 's apt phrase , Le Verrier had discovered a planet `` with the point of his pen '' ."
19673,"In retrospect , after it was discovered it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized , and there were others who made various calculations about its location , which did not lead to its observation ."
19674,"By 1846 the planet Uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by William Herschel in 1781 , and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path which could not be entirely explained by Newton 's law of gravitation ."
19675,"These irregularities could , however , be resolved if the gravity of a farther , unknown planet were disturbing its path around the Sun ."
19676,In 1845 astronomers Urbain Le Verrier in Paris and John Couch Adams in Cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet .
19677,"Unfortunately , Le Verrier 's triumph also led to a tense international dispute over priority , as , shortly after the discovery , George Airy , at the time British Astronomer Royal , announced that Adams had also predicted the discovery of the planet ."
19678,"Nevertheless , the Royal Society awarded Le Verrier the Copley medal in 1846 for his achievement , without mention of Adams ."

19751,"A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes , inks , paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors , each the result of partially or completely subtracting ( that is , absorbing ) some wavelengths of light and not others ."
19752,The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible .
19753,"Subtractive color systems start with light , presumably white light ."
19754,"Colored inks , paints , or filters between the viewer and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light , giving it color ."
19755,"If the incident light is other than white , our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well , but not perfectly , often giving a flawed impression of the `` true '' color of the surface ."
19756,"Conversely , additive color systems start with darkness ."
19757,Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors .
19758,The component lights may be inherently colored or simply white light that has passed through suitable subtractive color filters ; their combination is an additive one in either case .

19964,"When it was discontinued in 2007 , it had outlived many competitors that were either discontinued many years earlier or changed in concept to either a four-door sedan or small sport coupe ."
19965,The Monte Carlo endured six design generations .
19966,"The first four ( 1970–72 , 1973–77 , 1978–80 and 1981–88 ) were of a rear-wheel-drive , V8-powered ( V6 available beginning in 1978 ) coupe style , utilizing separate body-on-frame construction ."
19967,"The later rear-wheel-drive generations bucked the trend of unit-body construction , along with smaller engines , that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to meet increasing stringent fuel-economy regulations in the aftermath of two energy crises that led to gasoline shortages and skyrocketing pump prices in 1973-74 and 1979-80 ."
19968,"Despite those trends , the Monte Carlo remained a popular seller and even regained the SS version ( initially offered for 1970-71 with 454 cubic-inch V8 ) from mid-1983 to 1988 with a high-performance 305-cubic-inch V8 ."
19969,"Following a several year hiatus following the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988 , the nameplate was revived for 1995 on a front-drive , V6-powered coupe based on the Chevrolet Lumina sedan ."

19976,"In political philosophy the social contract or political contract is a theory or model , originating during the Age of Enlightenment , that typically addresses the questions of the origin of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual ."
19977,"Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented , either explicitly or tacitly , to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate ( or to the decision of a majority ) , in exchange for protection of their remaining rights ."
19978,"The question of the relation between natural and legal rights , therefore , is often an aspect of social contract theory ."
19979,"Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity , in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law , as well as in the Biblical idea of the covenant , the heyday of the social contract was the mid-seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries , when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy ."
19980,The starting point for most social contract theories is a heuristic examination of the human condition absent from any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the “ state of nature ” .
19981,"In this condition , individuals ' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience ."
19982,"From this shared starting point social contract theorists seek to demonstrate , in different ways , why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up his or her natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order ."
19983,"Hugo Grotius ( 1625 ) , Thomas Hobbes ( 1651 ) , Samuel Pufendorf ( 1673 ) , John Locke ( 1689 ) , Jean-Jacques Rousseau ( 1762 ) , and Immanuel Kant ( 1797 ) are among the most prominent of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theorists of social contract and natural rights ."
19984,Each solved the problem of political authority in a different way .
19985,Grotius posited that individual human beings had natural rights ; Hobbes asserted that men consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government ( whether monarchial or parliamentary ) ; Pufendorf disputed Hobbes 's equation of a state of nature with war .
19986,"Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable , and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority ; and Rousseau believed that democracy ( self-rule ) was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law ."
19987,The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence .
19988,"Social contract theories were eclipsed in the nineteenth century in favor of utilitarianism , Hegelianism , and Marxism , and were revived in the twentieth , notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls ."
19989,Sports are an important part of the culture of the United States .

19992,"Three of those leagues have teams that represent Canadian cities , and all four are among the most lucrative sports leagues in the world ."
19993,"Soccer ( association football ) is less popular as a spectator sport in the United States than it is in many other countries , though it has wide participation in amateur and semi-professional levels ."
19994,"The top league , Major League Soccer , continues to grow and has surpassed the NBA and the NHL in average attendance , although it lags far behind in revenue and TV viewership ."
19995,Professional teams in all major sports operate as franchises within a league .
19996,All major sports leagues use the same type of schedule with a playoff tournament after the regular season ends .
19997,"In addition to the major league-level organizations , several sports also have professional minor leagues ."

20001,A newton metre is a unit of torque ( also called `` moment `` ) in the SI system .
20002,"The symbolic form is N m or N·m , ."
20003,"One newton metre , sometimes hyphenated newton-metre , is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to a moment arm which is one metre long ."
20004,"It is also used less commonly as a unit of work , or energy , in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy , the joule ."
20005,"In this very different usage the metre term represents the distance traveled or displacement in the direction of the force , and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque ."
20006,"This usage is discouraged by the SI authority , since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton-meters is a torque or a quantity of energy ."
20007,Stockings on a fireplace mantel .
20008,A Christmas stocking hung on a bedpost .
20009,"A Christmas stocking is an empty sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Christmas Eve so that Santa Claus ( or Father Christmas ) can fill it with small toys , candy , fruit , coins or other small gifts when he arrives ."
20010,These small items are often referred to as stocking stuffers or stocking fillers .
20011,"In some Christmas stories , the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus ; in other stories ( and in tradition ) , some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree ."
20012,Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece of coal .
20013,"However , coal is rarely if ever left in a stocking , as it is considered cruel ."
20014,Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep .
20015,"Joseph Franklin Rutherford ( November 8 , 1869 – January 8 , 1942 ) , also known as `` Judge '' Rutherford , was the second president of the incorporated Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society ."
20016,"He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah 's Witnesses , which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell ."
20017,"Rutherford began a career in law , working as a court stenographer , trial lawyer and prosecutor ."
20018,"He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell , which led to his joining the Bible Student movement and was baptized in 1906 ."
20019,"He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907 , as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917 ."
20020,"His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society 's board of directors , in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers ."
20021,The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931 .
20022,"Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery , a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I ."
20023,Rutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the beliefs and practices of Jehovah 's Witnesses .
20024,"He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement , which he later called a theocracy , requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their activity ."

20521,"It was completed in 438 BC , although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC ."
20522,"It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece , generally considered the culmination of the development of the Doric order ."
20523,Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art .
20524,"The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece , Athenian democracy , western civilization and one of the world 's greatest cultural monuments ."
20525,The Greek Ministry of Culture is currently carrying out a program of selective restoration and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure .
20526,"The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena , which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon , that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC ."
20527,The temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the Hyades .
20528,"Like most Greek temples , the Parthenon was used as a treasury ."
20529,"For a time , it also served as the treasury of the Delian League , which later became the Athenian Empire ."

20538,"Usually , this takes the form of a sequence of F-tests , but other techniques are possible , such as t-tests , adjusted R-square , Akaike information criterion , Bayesian information criterion , Mallows 's Cp , or false discovery rate ."
20539,The frequent practice of fitting the final selected model followed by reporting estimates and confidence intervals without adjusting them to take the model building process into account has led to calls to stop using stepwise model building altogether or to at least make sure model uncertainty is correctly reflected .
20540,"In this example from engineering , necessity and sufficiency are usually determined by F-tests ."
20541,"For additional consideration , when planning an experiment , computer simulation , or scientific survey to collect data for this model , one must keep in mind the number of parameters , P , to estimate and adjust the sample size accordingly ."
20542,"For K variables , P = 1 ( Start ) + K ( Stage I ) + ( K2 − K ) /2 ( Stage II ) + 3K ( Stage III ) = 0.5K2 + 3.5K + 1 ."

20571,World map showing the Arctic Circle in red .
20572,Map of the Arctic with the Arctic Circle in blue .
20573,The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth .
20574,"In 2012 , it is the parallel of latitude that runs north of the Equator ."
20575,"The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic , and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone ."
20576,The equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere is called the Antarctic Circle .
20577,The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours ( at the June solstice and December solstice respectively ) .
20578,"North of the Arctic Circle , the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore visible at midnight ) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ."
20579,"On the Arctic Circle those events occur , in principle , exactly once per year , at the June and December solstices , respectively ."
20580,"It would therefore seem that the Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere polar day ( 24-hour sunlit day , often referred to as the midnight sun ) and polar night ( 24-hour sunless night ) ."
20581,"In fact , because of atmospheric refraction and mirages , and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point , part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 ′ ( ) south of the Arctic Circle ; similarly , on the day of the northern winter solstice , part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle ."
20582,"That is true at sea level ; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions , there is often no direct view of the true horizon ."
20583,The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed .
20584,"It directly depends on the Earth 's axial tilt , which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period , notably due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon ."
20585,The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about per year ; see Circle of latitude for more information .

20588,Traffic lights were first installed in 1868 in London and are now used all over the world .
20589,"Traffic lights alternate the right of way accorded to road users by displaying lights of a standard color ( red , yellow/amber , and green ) following a universal color code ."
20590,In the typical sequence of color phases:
20591,"the green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted , if it is safe to do so"
20592,"the yellow/amber light denoting prepare to stop short of the intersection , if it is safe to do so"
20593,the red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding
20594,An epileptic seizure ( colloquially a fit ) is a transient symptom of `` abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain '' .
20595,The outward effect can be as dramatic as a wild thrashing movement ( tonic-clonic seizure ) or as mild as a brief loss of awareness ( absence seizure ) .
20596,"It can manifest as an alteration in , tonic or clonic movements , convulsions , and various other psychic symptoms ( such as déjà vu or jamais vu ) ."
20597,"Sometimes it is not accompanied by convulsions but a full body `` slump '' , where the person simply will lose body control and slump to the ground ."
20598,"The medical syndrome of recurrent , unprovoked seizures is termed epilepsy , but seizures can occur in people who do not have epilepsy ."
20599,"For more information , see non-epileptic seizure ."
20600,"Epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide , nearly 80 % of whom live in developing countries ."
20601,About 4 % of all people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80 and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 30 % and 50 % .
20602,Treatment may reduce the chance of a second one by as much as half .
20603,"Most single episode seizures are managed by primary care physicians ( emergency or general practitioners ) , whereas investigation and management of ongoing epilepsy is usually done by neurologists ."

20618,"In coding theory , block codes comprise the large and important family of error-correcting codes that encode data in blocks ."
20619,"There is a vast number of examples for block codes , many of which have a wide range of practical applications ."
20620,"Block Codes are conceptually useful because they allow coding theorists , mathematicians , and computer scientists to study the limitations of all block codes in a unified way ."
20621,"Such limitations often take the form of bounds that relate different parameters of the block code to each other , such as its rate and its ability to detect and correct errors ."
20622,"Examples of block codes are Reed–Solomon codes , Hamming codes , Hadamard codes , Expander codes , Golay codes , and Reed–Muller codes ."
20623,"These examples also belong to the class of linear codes , and hence they are called linear block codes ."

20659,Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma .
20660,It is produced in the liver .
20661,Albumin constitutes about half of the blood serum protein .
20662,It is soluble and monomeric .
20663,"Albumin transports hormones , fatty acids , and other compounds , buffers pH , and maintains osmotic pressure , among other functions ."
20664,"Albumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin , which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum ."
20665,"The product , proalbumin , is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin ."

20867,"Lipoic acid ( LA ) , also known as α-lipoic acid and alpha lipoic acid ( ALA ) is an organosulfur compound derived from octanoic acid ."
20868,LA contains two sulfur atoms ( at C6 and C8 ) connected by a disulfide bond and is thus considered to be oxidized although either sulfur atom can exist in higher oxidation states .
20869,The carbon atom at C6 is chiral and the molecule exists as two enantiomers ( R ) - ( + ) -lipoic acid ( RLA ) and ( S ) - ( - ) -lipoic acid ( SLA ) and as a racemic mixture ( R/S ) -lipoic acid ( R/S-LA ) .
20870,Only the ( R ) - ( + ) -enantiomer exists in nature and is an essential cofactor of four mitochondrial enzyme complexes .
20871,Endogenously synthesized RLA is essential for aerobic metabolism .

20873,LA appears physically as a yellow solid and structurally contains a terminal carboxylic acid and a terminal dithiolane ring .
20874,The relationship between endogenously synthesized ( enzyme–bound ) RLA and administered free RLA or R/S-LA has not been fully characterized but free plasma and cellular levels increase and decrease rapidly after oral consumption or intravenous injections .
20875,"`` Lipoate '' is the conjugate base of lipoic acid , and the most prevalent form of LA under physiologic conditions ."
20876,"Although the intracellular environment is strongly reducing , both free LA and its reduced form , dihydrolipoic acid ( DHLA ) , have been detected in cells after administration of LA ."
20877,"Most endogenously produced RLA is not “free” because octanoic acid , the precursor to RLA , is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms ."
20878,"As a cofactor , RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme’s lipoyl domains ."
20879,"One of the most studied roles of RLA is as a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC or PDHC ) , though it is a cofactor in other enzymatic systems as well ( described below ) ."

21123,"The phrases `` front 40 '' and `` back 40 , '' referring to farm fields , indicate quarter-quarter sections of land ."
21124,One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres .
21125,"A section can be halved seven times in this way , down to a parcel , or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section—an easily surveyed 50 square chain area ."
21126,"This system was of great practical value on the American frontier , where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly ."
21127,"A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form , might look like `` NW 1/4 , NE 1/4 , Sec . 34 , T.3S , R.1W , 1st P.M. '' ."

21135,"A refractory brick is built primarily to withstand high temperature , but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency ."
21136,"Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical , chemical , or thermal stresses , such as the inside of a wood-fired kiln or a furnace , which is subject to abrasion from wood , fluxing from ash or slag , and high temperatures ."
21137,"In other , less harsh situations , such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln , more porous bricks , commonly known as `` kiln bricks '' are a better choice ."
21138,"They are weaker , but they are much lighter , easier to form , and insulate far better than dense bricks ."
21139,"In any case , firebricks should not spall under rapid temperature change , and their strength should hold up well during rapid temperature changes ."

21158,Taste bud
21159,"Taste , gustatory perception , or gustation is one of the five traditional senses ."
21160,Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with receptors of taste buds .
21161,"Taste , along with smell ( olfaction ) and trigeminal nerve stimulation ( which also handles touch for texture , also pain , and temperature ) , determines flavors , the sensory impressions of food or other substances ."
21162,"Humans perceive taste through sensory organs called taste buds , or gustatory calyculi , concentrated on the top of the tongue ."
21163,"The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae , which are easily visible to the naked eye ."
21164,"Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds , the organ of taste transduction ."
21165,There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue .
21166,"Others are located on the roof , sides and back of the mouth , and in the throat ."
21167,Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells .
21168,"Taste perception fades with age : On average , people lose half their taste receptors by time they turn 20 ."
21169,"The sensation of taste can be categorized into five basic tastes : sweetness , sourness , saltiness , bitterness , and umami ."
21170,Taste buds are able to differentiate between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions .
21171,"Sweet , umami , and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds ."
21172,"Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds , respectively ."
21173,"As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things , all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive , depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies ."
21174,"Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods , while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons ."
21175,"The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth — other factors include smell , detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose ; texture , detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors , muscle nerves , etc . ; temperature , detected by thermoreceptors ; and `` coolness '' ( such as of menthol ) and `` hotness '' ( pungency ) , through chemesthesis ."

21207,Brain tumors include all tumors inside the cranium or in the central spinal canal .
21208,"They are created by an abnormal and uncontrolled cell division , usually in the brain itself , but also in lymphatic tissue , in blood vessels , in the cranial nerves , in the brain envelopes ( meninges ) , skull , pituitary gland , or pineal gland ."
21209,"Within the brain itself , the involved cells may be neurons or glial cells ( which include astrocytes , oligodendrocytes , and ependymal cells ) ."
21210,Brain tumors may also spread from cancers primarily located in other organs ( metastatic tumors ) .
21211,Any brain tumor is inherently serious and life-threatening because of its invasive and infiltrative character in the limited space of the intracranial cavity .
21212,"However , brain tumors ( even malignant ones ) are not invariably fatal , especially lipomas which are inherently benign ."
21213,"Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous ( malignant ) or non-cancerous ( benign ) ; however , the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body ."
21214,"Its threat level depends on the combination of factors like the type of tumor , its location , its size and its state of development ."
21215,"Because the brain is well protected by the skull , the early detection of a brain tumor occurs only when diagnostic tools are directed at the intracranial cavity ."
21216,Usually detection occurs in advanced stages when the presence of the tumor has caused unexplained symptoms .
21217,"Primary ( true ) brain tumors are commonly located in the posterior cranial fossa in children and in the anterior two-thirds of the cerebral hemispheres in adults , although they can affect any part of the brain ."

21221,A scene of volleyball play in an Erwadi village .
21222,The complete rules are extensive .
21223,"But simply , play proceeds as follows : a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally ' by serving the ball ( tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm ) , from behind the back boundary line of the court , over the net , and into the receiving team 's court ."
21224,The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court .
21225,The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively .
21226,"Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court ."
21227,"The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either ( 1 ) : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or ( 2 ) : a team commits a fault and loses the rally ."
21228,"The team that wins the rally is awarded a point , and serves the ball to start the next rally ."

21236,"The ball is usually played with the hands or arms , but players can legally strike or push ( short contact ) the ball with any part of the body ."
21237,"A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball , including spiking and blocking ( because these plays are made above the top of the net , the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport ) as well as passing , setting , and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures ."

21286,"In common usage the words pipe and tube are usually interchangeable , but in industry and engineering , the terms are uniquely defined ."
21287,"Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured , pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter ( OD ) and a schedule that defines the thickness ."
21288,"Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness , but may be specified by any two of OD , inside diameter ( ID ) , and wall thickness ."
21289,Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards .
21290,"While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing , tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances ."
21291,Many industrial and government standards exist for the production of pipe and tubing .
21292,"The term `` tube '' is also commonly applied to non-cylindrical sections , i.e. , square or rectangular tubing ."

21374,"LTE is , therefore , anticipated to become the first truly global mobile phone standard , although the use of different frequency bands in different countries will mean that only multi-band phones will be able to use LTE in all countries where it is supported ."
21375,"Although marketed as a 4G wireless service , LTE as specified in the 3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series does not satisfy the technical requirements the 3GPP consortium has adopted for its new standard generation , and which were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in its IMT-Advanced specification ."
21376,"However , due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that WIMAX , HSPA+ and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies , ITU later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies ."
21377,The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be considered IMT-Advanced .

21425,"Often , chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems , such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease ."
21426,"Chronic kidney disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications , such as cardiovascular disease , anemia or pericarditis ."
21427,Chronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine .
21428,Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products .
21429,"Creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of CKD , and the condition is discovered if urinalysis ( testing of a urine sample ) shows that the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine ."

21453,"The lake partly fills a nearly deep caldera that was formed around 7,700 ( ± 150 ) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama ."
21454,Human interaction is traceable back to the indigenous Native Americans witnessing the eruption of Mount Mazama .
21455,There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake ; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years .
21456,"At 1,943 feet ( 592 meters ) , it is the deepest lake in the United States , and the seventh deepest in the world ."
21457,"Crater Lake is known for the `` Old Man of the Lake `` , a full-sized tree which is now a stump that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century ."
21458,"The low temperature of the water has slowed the decomposition of the wood , hence the longevity of the bobbing tree ."
21459,"Two islands are in Crater Lake , with Wizard Island from a cinder cone that erupted after Crater Lake began to fill with water , and Phantom Ship Island with seven different trees living on it ."
21460,"There are also colonies of violet green swallows , and several varieties of wildflowers and lichens living there ."

21468,Close up of a human iris
21469,Eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris .
21470,"In humans , the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black , depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium ( located on the back of the iris ) , the melanin content within the iris stroma ( located at the front of the iris ) , and the cellular density of the stroma ."
21471,"The appearance of blue , green , as well as hazel eyes results from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the stroma , a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky ."
21472,Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid .
21473,"Eye color is thus an instance of structural color and varies depending on the lighting conditions , especially for lighter-colored eyes ."
21474,"The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments , such as pteridines , purines , and carotenoids ."
21475,Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color .
21476,"The genetics of eye color are complicated , and color is determined by multiple genes ."
21477,"So far , as many as 15 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance ."
21478,Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2 .
21479,The once-held view that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect .
21480,The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur .
21481,"However , OCA2 gene polymorphism , close to proximal 5′ regulatory region , explains most human eye-color variation ."

21530,"The drawer writes the various details including the monetary amount , date , and a payee on the cheque , and signs it , ordering their bank , known as the drawee , to pay that person or company the amount of money stated ."
21531,Cheques are a type of bill of exchange and were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money .
21532,"While paper money evolved from promissory notes , another form of negotiable instrument , similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession ( the `` bearer `` ) ."
21533,"Technically , a cheque is a negotiable instrument instructing a financial institution to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified transactional account held in the drawer 's name with that institution ."
21534,Both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities .
21535,"Specifically , cheques are order instruments , and are not in general payable simply to the bearer ( as bearer instruments are ) but must be paid to the payee ."
21536,"In some countries , such as the US , the payee may endorse the cheque , allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid ."
21537,"Although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century , it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular non- cash method for making payments and the usage of cheques peaked ."
21538,"By the second half of the 20th century , as cheque processing became automated , billions of cheques were issued annually ; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s ."
21539,"Since then cheque usage has fallen , being partly replaced by electronic payment systems ."
21540,In some countries like Poland and Ukraine cheques have become a marginal payment system or have been phased out completely .

21542,The Women 's Tennis Association has ranked her World No . 1 in singles on six separate occasions .
21543,"She became the World No . 1 for the first time on July 8 , 2002 , and regained this ranking for the sixth time on February 18 , 2013 , becoming the oldest world no . 1 player in WTA 's history ."
21544,She is the only female player to have won over $ 40 million in prize money .
21545,"Regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time , Williams is the only player to have achieved a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles ."
21546,"Her 30 Grand Slam titles ties her for eighth on the all-time list : 15 in singles , 13 in women 's doubles , and 2 in mixed doubles ."
21547,"She is the most recent player , male or female , to have held all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously ( '02–'03 ) and only the fifth woman ever to do so ."
21548,"Her total of 15 Grand Slam singles titles is sixth on the all-time list , and fourth in the open era , behind Steffi Graf ( 22 titles ) and Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova ( 18 titles each ) ."

21553,"American wire gauge ( AWG ) , also known as the Brown & Sharpe wire gauge , is a standardized wire gauge system used since 1857 predominantly in the United States and Canada for the diameters of round , solid , nonferrous , electrically conducting wire ."
21554,The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity .
21555,The steel industry does not use AWG and prefers a number of other wire gauges .
21556,"These include Washburn & Moen ( or W & M ) Wire Gauge , US Steel Wire Gauge , and Music Wire Gauge ( see Piano wire ) ."
21557,"Increasing gauge numbers give decreasing wire diameters , which is similar to many other non- metric gauging systems ."
21558,This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire .
21559,"Very fine wire ( for example , 30 gauge ) required more passes through the drawing dies than did 0 gauge wire ."
21560,Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems ; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose .
21561,"The AWG tables are for a single , solid , round conductor ."
21562,"The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the total cross-sectional area of the conductor , which determines its current-carrying capacity and electrical resistance ."
21563,"Because there are also small gaps between the strands , a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG ."
21564,"AWG is also commonly used to specify body piercing jewelry sizes ( especially smaller sizes ) , even when the material is not metallic ."
21565,"The Giant 's Causeway ( known as Clochán an Aifir or Clochán na bhFomhórach in Irish and tha Giant 's Causey in Ulster-Scots ) is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns , the result of an ancient volcanic eruption ."
21566,"It is located in County Antrim on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland , about three miles ( 4.8 km ) northeast of the town of Bushmills ."
21567,"It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 , and a National Nature Reserve in 1987 by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland ."
21568,"In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , the Giant 's Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom ."
21569,The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea .
21570,"Most of the columns are hexagonal , although there are also some with four , five , seven or eight sides ."
21571,"The tallest are about 12 metres ( 39 ft ) high , and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres thick in places ."
21572,The Giant 's Causeway is today owned and managed by the National Trust and it is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern Ireland .
21573,Spiced strips of jerky
21574,"Jerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat , cut into strips , and then dried to prevent spoilage ."
21575,"Normally , this drying includes the addition of salt , to prevent bacteria from developing on the meat before sufficient moisture has been removed ."
21576,The word `` jerky '' is derived from the Spanish word charqui which is from the Quechua word ch'arki .
21577,which means to burn ( meat ) .
21578,"All that is needed to produce basic `` jerky '' is a low-temperature drying method , and salt to inhibit bacterial growth ."
21579,"Modern manufactured jerky is normally marinated in a seasoned spice rub or liquid , and dried , dehydrated or smoked with low heat ( usually under 70 °C/160 °F ) ."
21580,Some makers still use just salt and sun-dry fresh sliced meat to make jerky .
21581,"Some product manufacturers finely grind meat , mix in seasonings , and press the meat-paste into flat shapes prior to drying ."
21582,The resulting jerky from the above methods would be a salty and/or savory snack .
21583,"However , often a sweet or semi-sweet recipe is used , with sugar being a major ingredient ( in contrast to biltong which is a dried meat product that utilizes the acid in vinegar rather than salt to inhibit bacterial growth when drying the meat ) ."
21584,Jerky is ready-to-eat and needs no additional preparation .
21585,It can be stored for months without refrigeration .
21586,"When the protein to moisture content ratio is correct , the resulting meat is cured , or preserved ."
21587,"There are many products in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed , chopped and formed meat , rather than traditional sliced , whole-muscle meat ."
21588,"These products may contain more fat , but moisture content , like the whole-muscle product , must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the US ."
21589,"Chemical preservatives can be used to prevent oxidative spoilage , but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity ."
21590,"Many jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet , unlike biltong , which rarely contains added sugars ."
21591,"A typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10-15 g of protein , 1 g of fat , and 0-3 g of carbohydrates ."
21592,"Since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure , sodium can be a concern for some people ."
21593,"A 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium , which would be about 30 % of the recommended USRDA ."

21624,The film was produced by the Haxan Films production company .
21625,"Though fictional , it is presented as `` found footage `` , as if pieced together from amateur footage , and popularised this style of horror movie ."
21626,"The film relates the story of three student filmmakers ( Heather Donahue , Joshua Leonard , and Michael C. Williams ) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville , Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch ."
21627,"The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again , although their video and sound equipment ( along with most of the footage they shot ) was discovered a year later by the police department and that this `` recovered footage '' is the film the viewer is watching ."
21628,"The film received enormously positive reception from critics and went on to gross over US $ 248 million worldwide , making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time ."

21634,An 1870 oil painting by Ford Madox Brown depicting Romeo and Juliet famous balcony scene
21635,Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written early in the career of William Shakespeare about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families .
21636,"It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and , along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays ."
21637,"Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers ."
21638,Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity .
21639,"Its plot is based on an Italian tale , translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 ."
21640,"Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but , to expand the plot , developed supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris ."
21641,"Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 ."
21642,"This text was of poor quality , and later editions corrected it , bringing it more in line with Shakespeare 's original ."
21643,"Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure , especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story , has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill ."
21644,"The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops ."
21645,"Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play ."
21646,"Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical and opera ."
21647,"During the English Restoration , it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant ."
21648,"David Garrick 's 18th-century version also modified several scenes , removing material then considered indecent , and Georg Benda 's operatic adaptation omitted much of the action and added a happy ending ."
21649,"Performances in the 19th century , including Charlotte Cushman 's , restored the original text , and focused on greater realism ."
21650,"John Gielgud 's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare 's text , and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama ."
21651,"In the 20th century the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor 's comparatively faithful 1936 production , Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 version , and Baz Luhrmann 's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet ."

21657,"The herons are long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae , with 64 recognised species ( some are called `` egrets `` or `` bitterns `` instead of `` heron '' ) ."
21658,"Within Ardeidae , all members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as `` bitterns '' , and — including the Zigzag Heron or Zigzag Bittern — are a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae ."
21659,"However , egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons , and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white and/or have decorative plumes ."
21660,"Although egrets have the same build as herons , they tend to be smaller ."
21661,"The classification of the individual heron/egret species is fraught with difficulty , and there is still no clear consensus about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera , Ardea and Egretta ."
21662,"Similarly , the relationship of the genera in the family is not completely resolved ."
21663,"However , one species formerly considered to constitute a separate monotypic family Cochlearidae , the Boat-billed Heron , is now regarded as a member of the Ardeidae ."
21664,"Although herons resemble birds in some other families , such as the storks , ibises , spoonbills and cranes , they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted , not outstretched ."
21665,They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down .
21666,"Some members of this group nest colonially in trees , while others , notably the bitterns , use reedbeds ."
21667,"Saint Patrick 's Day or the Feast of Saint Patrick ( , `` the Day of the Festival of Patrick '' ) is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated on 17 March ."

21670,"The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland , as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general ."
21671,"Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals , céilithe , and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks ."
21672,"Christians also attend church services , and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day , which has encouraged and propagated the holiday 's tradition of alcohol consumption ."
21673,"Saint Patrick 's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland , Newfoundland and Labrador and Montserrat ."

21684,Outdoor components of a residential air-source heat pump
21685,A heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a heat source to a heat sink against a temperature gradient .
21686,Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite the direction of spontaneous heat flow .
21687,A heat pump uses some amount of external high-grade energy to accomplish the desired transfer of thermal energy from heat source to heat sink .
21688,"While compressor-driven air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps , the term `` heat pump '' is more general and applies to HVAC devices used for space heating or space cooling ."
21689,"When a heat pump is used for heating , it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction , releasing heat into the conditioned-space rather than the surrounding environment ."
21690,"In this use , heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground ."
21691,"During the twentieth century , women of the world became indispensable in the war efforts ."
21692,"In many countries the need for female participation in the First World War was seen as almost necessary , as unprecedented numbers of men were wounded and killed ."

21697,"The Wire premiered on June 2 , 2002 , and ended on March 9 , 2008 , comprising 60 episodes over five seasons ."
21698,Each season of The Wire focuses on a different facet of the city of Baltimore .
21699,"In chronological order they are : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , the school system , and the print news media ."
21700,The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles .
21701,"Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama , the show is `` really about the American city , and about how we live together ."
21702,It 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals .
21703,"Whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution they are committed to . ''"
21704,"Despite only receiving modest ratings and never winning major television awards , The Wire has been described by many critics as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time ."
21705,"The show is recognized for its realistic portrayal of urban life , its literary ambitions , and its uncommonly deep exploration of sociopolitical themes ."
21706,"This is a list of political parties in the United States , both past and present ."
21707,"A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus , bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as `` humps '' on its back ."

21709,"Both species have been domesticated ; they provide milk , meat , hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches , and are working animals ."
21710,"Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm , at the entrance to the River Mersey in North West England ."
21711,The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is a 845 megawatt ( MW ) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon .
21712,"Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy , such as using wind turbines to make electrical power , windmills for mechanical power , wind pumps for water pumping or drainage , or sails to propel ships ."
21713,Large wind farms consist of hundreds of individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network .
21714,"Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land , and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher ."
21715,Small onshore wind farms provide electricity to isolated locations .
21716,Utility companies increasingly buy surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines .
21717,"Wind power , as an alternative to fossil fuels , is plentiful , renewable , widely distributed , clean , produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and uses little land ."
21718,The effects on the environment are generally less problematic than those from other power sources .
21719,"As of 2011 , Denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind and 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis ."
21720,"In 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5 % of total worldwide electricity usage , and growing rapidly at more than 25 % per annum ."
21721,The monetary cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations .
21722,Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales .
21723,"The intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when used to supply up to 20 % of total electricity demand , but as the proportion increases , a need to upgrade the grid , and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur ."
21724,"Power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage , geographically distributed turbines , dispatchable backing sources , storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low , can greatly mitigate these problems ."
21725,"In addition , weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur ."

21976,"In botany , it can refer to the segments of the leg a pinnate frond blade and is discussed in that section ."
21977,"Margot Betti Frank ( 16 February 1926 – 9 March 1945 ) was the eldest daughter of Otto and Edith Frank , and the older sister of Anne Frank , whose deportation order from the Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding , and who subsequently perished in Bergen-Belsen ."
21978,"According to the diary of her younger sister Anne , Margot was keeping a diary as well , but no trace of Margot 's diary has ever been found ."
21979,"Plasma ( from Greek πλάσμα , `` anything formed '' ) is one of the four fundamental states of matter ( the others being solid , liquid , and gas ) ."
21980,"Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms ( reducing or increasing the number of electrons in them ) , thus turning it into a plasma , which contains charged particles : positive ions and negative electrons or ions ."
21981,"Ionization can be induced by other means , such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator , and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds , if present ."
21982,The presence of a non-negligible number of charge carriers makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields .
21983,"Plasma , therefore , has properties quite unlike those of solids , liquids , or gases and is considered a distinct state of matter ."
21984,"Like gas , plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container ; unlike gas , under the influence of a magnetic field , it may form structures such as filaments , beams and double layers ."
21985,Some common plasmas are found in stars and neon signs .
21986,"In the universe , plasma is the most common state of matter for ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic plasma ( particularly intracluster medium ) and in stars ."
21987,"Much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis ."
21988,The Circuit Courts of Maryland are the state trial courts of general jurisdiction in Maryland .
21989,"They are Maryland 's highest courts of record exercising original jurisdiction at law and in equity in all civil and criminal matters , and have such additional powers and jurisdiction as conferred by the Maryland Constitution or by law ."
21990,The Circuit Courts also preside over divorce and most family law matters .
21991,Probate and estate matters are handled by a separate Orphans ' Court .
21992,The Circuit Courts are the only Maryland state courts empowered to conduct jury trials .
21993,"Station identification ( ident or channel ID ) is the practice of radio or television stations or networks identifying themselves on air , typically by means of a call sign or brand name ( sometimes known , particularly in the United States , as a `` sounder '' or `` stinger '' , more generally as a station or network ID ) ."
21994,"This may be to satisfy requirements of licensing authorities , a form of branding or a combination of both ."
21995,"As such it is closely related to production logos used in television and cinema , alike ."
21996,"Station identification used to be done regularly by an announcer at the halfway point during the presentation of a television program , or in between programs ."
21997,"A leap year ( or intercalary or bissextile year ) is a year containing one additional day ( or , in the case of lunisolar calendars , a month ) in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year ."
21998,"Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days , a calendar that had the same number of days in each year would , over time , drift with respect to the event it was supposed to track ."
21999,"By occasionally inserting ( or intercalating ) an additional day or month into the year , the drift can be corrected ."
22000,A year that is not a leap year is called a common year .
22001,"For example , in the Gregorian calendar ( a common solar calendar ) , February in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28 , so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365 ."
22002,"Similarly , in the Hebrew calendar ( a lunisolar calendar ) , Adar Aleph , a 13th lunar month is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons ."
22003,"The term leap year gets its name from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next , in a leap year the day of the week will advance two days ( from March onwards ) due to the year 's extra day inserted at the end of February ( thus `` leaping over '' one of the days in the week ) ."
22004,"For example , Christmas Day fell on Saturday in 2004 , Sunday in 2005 , Monday in 2006 and Tuesday in 2007 but then `` leapt '' over Wednesday to fall on a Thursday in 2008 ."
22005,"Henry Ford ( July 30 , 1863 – April 7 , 1947 ) was an American industrialist , the founder of the Ford Motor Company , and sponsor of the development of the assembly line technique of mass production ."
22006,"Although Ford did not invent the automobile , he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford to buy ."
22007,His introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized transportation and American industry .
22008,"As owner of the Ford Motor Company , he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world ."
22009,He is credited with `` Fordism `` : mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers .
22010,"Ford had a global vision , with consumerism as the key to peace ."
22011,"His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations , including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents ."
22012,Ford left most of his vast wealth to the Ford Foundation but arranged for his family to control the company permanently .
22013,"Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I , but also for being the publisher of antisemitic texts such as the book The International Jew ."
22014,"Bethlehem is a city in Lehigh and Northampton Counties in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania , in the United States ."
22015,"As of the 2010 census , the city had a total population of 74,982 , making it the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania , after Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Allentown , Erie , Reading , and Scranton ."
22016,"Bethlehem lies in the center of the Lehigh Valley , a region of 731 square miles ( 1,893 km2 ) that is home to more than 800,000 people ."
22017,"The Valley embraces a trio of cities ( Bethlehem , Allentown and Easton ) within two counties ( Lehigh and Northampton ) , making it Pennsylvania 's third-largest metropolitan area ."
22018,"Smaller than Allentown but larger than Easton , Bethlehem is the Lehigh Valley 's second most populous city ."
22019,"There are three general sections of the city : North Bethlehem , South Bethlehem and West Bethlehem ."
22020,Each of these sections blossomed at different times in the city 's development and each contains areas recognized under the National Register of Historic Places .
22021,"Zip codes that use the address Bethlehem totaled 116,000 in population in the year 2000 ."
22022,These zip codes include Bethlehem Township .
22023,"In July 2006 , Money magazine placed Bethlehem as number 88 on its `` Top 100 Best Places to Live . ''"

22027,World map showing percent of population living in an urban environment .
22028,An urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it .
22029,"Urban areas may be cities , towns or conurbations , but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets ."
22030,Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization .
22031,"Measuring the extent of an urban area helps in analyzing population density and urban sprawl , and in determining urban and rural populations ."
22032,"Unlike an urban area , a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area , but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city , typically by employment ties through commuting , with the urban core city being the primary labor market ."
22033,"In the US , Metropolitan areas tend to be defined using counties or county sized political units as building blocks of much larger , albeit more condensed population units ."
22034,Counties tend to be stable political boundaries ; economists prefer to work with economic and social statistics based on metropolitan areas .
22035,Urbanized areas are a more relevant statistic for determining per capita land usage and densities .
22036,"Knossos ( alternative spellings Knossus , Cnossus , Greek Κνωσός , is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and considered as Europe 's oldest city ."
22037,The name Knossos survives from ancient Greek references to the major city of Crete .
22038,"The identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by tradition and by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site , then a large mound named Kephala Hill , elevation from current sea level ."
22039,"Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse , both symbols deriving from the myth of King Minos , supposed to have reigned from Knossos ."
22040,"The coins came from the Roman settlement of Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus , a Roman colony placed just to the north of , and politically including , Kephala ."
22041,The Romans believed they had colonized Knossos .
22042,"After excavation , the discovery of the Linear B tablets , and the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris , the identification was confirmed by the reference to an administrative center , ko-no-so , Mycenaean Greek Knosos , undoubtedly the palace complex ."
22043,The palace was built over a Neolithic town .
22044,"During the Bronze Age , the town surrounded the hill on which the palace was built ."
22045,The palace was excavated and partially restored under the direction of Arthur Evans in the earliest years of the 20th century .
22046,"Its size far exceeded his original expectations , as did the discovery of two ancient scripts , which he termed Linear A and Linear B , to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present ."
22047,"From the layering of the palace Evans developed de novo an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it , which he called Minoan , following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan ."
22048,The palace of Knossos was undoubtedly the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture .
22049,"It appears as a maze of workrooms , living spaces , and storerooms close to a central square ."
22050,"An approximate graphic view of some aspects of Cretan life in the Bronze Age is provided by restorations of the palace 's indoor and outdoor murals , as it is also by the decorative motifs of the pottery and the insignia on the seals and sealings ."
22051,"The palace was abandoned at some unknown time at the end of the Late Bronze Age , ca . 1380–1100 BC ."
22052,"The occasion is not known for certain , but one of the many disasters that befell the palace is generally put forward ."
22053,"The abandoning population were probably Mycenaean Greeks , who had earlier occupied the city-state , and were using Linear B as its administrative script , as opposed to Linear A , the previous administrative script ."
22054,"The hill was never again a settlement or civic site , although squatters may have used it for a time ."
22055,"Except for periods of abandonment , other cities were founded in the immediate vicinity , such as the Roman colony , and a Hellenistic Greek precedent ."
22056,The population shifted to the new town of Chandax ( modern Heraklion ) during the 9th century AD .
22057,"By the 13th century , it was called Makruteikhos 'Long Wall ' ; the bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves Bishops of Knossos until the 19th century ."
22058,"Today , the name is used only for the archaeological site now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion ."

22072,"This pentacle , worn as a pendant , depicts a pentagram , or five-pointed star , used as a symbol of Wicca by many adherents ."
22073,"Wicca ( ) is a modern pagan , witchcraft religion ."
22074,"It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and it was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner , a retired British civil servant ."
22075,It draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice .
22076,Wicca is a diverse religion with no central authority or figure defining it .
22077,"It is divided into various lineages and denominations , referred to as `` traditions '' , each with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation ."
22078,"Due to its decentralized nature , there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca ."
22079,"Some traditions , collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca , strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term `` Wicca '' to apply only to such lineaged traditions , while other eclectic traditions do not ."
22080,"Wicca is typically duotheistic , worshipping a god and goddess traditionally viewed as a mother goddess and horned god ."
22081,These two deities are often viewed as facets of a greater pantheistic godhead .
22082,"However , beliefs range from `` hard '' polytheism to even monotheism ."
22083,Wiccan celebration follows approximately eight seasonally based festivals known as Sabbats .
22084,An unattributed statement known as the Wiccan Rede is the traditional basis of Wiccan morality .
22085,Wicca involves the ritual practice of magic .
22086,"J. M. Flagg 's 1917 poster , based on the original British Lord Kitchener poster of three years earlier , was used to recruit soldiers for both World War I and World War II ."
22087,"Flagg used a modified version of his own face for Uncle Sam , and veteran Walter Botts provided the pose ."
22088,"Uncle Sam ( initials U.S. ) is a common national personification of the American government that , according to legend , came into use during the War of 1812 and was supposedly named for Samuel Wilson ."
22089,"The first use of Uncle Sam in literature was in the 1816 allegorical book `` The Adventures of Uncle Sam in Search After His Lost Honor '' by Frederick Augustus Fidfaddy , Esq . An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775 , in the original `` Yankee Doodle `` lyrics of the Revolutionary War ."
22090,It is not clear whether this reference is to Uncle Sam as a metaphor for the United States .
22091,"The lyrics as a whole clearly deride the military efforts of the young nation , besieging the British at Boston ."
22092,The 13th stanza is:
22093,Old Uncle Sam come there to change

22095,"For ’lasses cakes , to carry home"
22096,To give his wife and young ones .
22097,"Karma ( Sanskrit , also karman , Pāli : Kamma ) means `` action '' or `` doing '' ; whatever one does , says , or thinks is a karma ."
22098,"In Buddhism , the term karma is used specifically for those actions which spring from the intention ( Sanskrit : cetanā , Pali : cetana ) of an unenlightened being ."
22099,"These bring about a fruit ( Sanskrit , Pali : phala ) or result ( S. , P. vipāka ; the two are often used together as vipākaphala ) , either within the present life , or in the context of a future rebirth ."
22100,Other Indian religions have different views on karma .
22101,"Karma is the engine which drives the wheel of the cycle of uncontrolled rebirth ( S. , P. ' ) for each being ."
22102,"In the early texts it is not , however , the only causal mechanism influencing the lives of sentient beings ."
22103,"As one scholar states , `` the Buddhist theory of action and result ( karmaphala ) is fundamental to much of Buddhist doctrine , because it provides a coherent model of the functioning of the world and its beings , which in turn forms the doctrinal basis for the Buddhist explanations of the path of liberation from the world and its result , nirvāṇa . ''"
22104,A typical medical syringe with needle
22105,A syringe is a simple pump consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube .
22106,"The plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube ( called a barrel ) , allowing the syringe to take in and expel a liquid or gas through an at the open end of the tube ."
22107,"The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle , a nozzle , or tubing to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel ."
22108,"Syringes are often used to administer injections , insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream , apply compounds such as glue or lubricant , and measure liquids ."
22109,The word `` syringe '' is derived from the Greek συριγξ syrinx = `` tube '' via back-formation of a new singular from its Greek-type plural `` syringes '' ( συριγγες syringes ) .
22110,Maximum life span refers to a measure of the maximum amount of time one or more members of a population has been observed to survive between birth and death .
22111,"The term can also denote an estimate of the maximum amount of time that a member of a given species could survive between life and death , provided circumstances that are optimal to their longevity ."
22112,Most living species have at least one upper limit on the number of times cells can divide .
22113,"For humans , this is called the Hayflick limit , although number of cell divisions does not strictly control lifespan ( non-dividing cells and dividing cells lived over 120 years in the oldest known human ) ."
22114,"David Carradine ( born John Arthur Carradine ; December 8 , 1936 – June 3 , 2009 ) was an American actor and martial artist , best known for his leading role as a warrior monk , Kwai Chang Caine , in the 1970s television series Kung Fu ."

22116,"His acting career , which included major and minor roles on stage , television and cinema , spanned over four decades ."
22117,"A prolific `` B '' movie actor , he appeared in more than 100 feature films and was nominated four times for a Golden Globe Award ."
22118,The last nomination was for his title role in Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill .
22119,Films that featured Carradine continued to be released after his death .
22120,"These posthumous credits were from a variety of genres including horror , action , western , martial arts , drama , science fiction and documentary ."
22121,"In addition to his acting career , Carradine was also a musician and pursued a directing career ."
22122,"Influenced by his most popular acting role , he studied martial arts ."
22123,"The son of a frequently married actor , he had an unstable childhood ."
22124,This instability would continue throughout his life as he himself was married five times .
22125,He was also frequently arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses which often involved substance abuse .
22126,"He died on June 3 , 2009 , apparently of auto-erotic asphyxiation ."
22127,"Bowel obstruction ( or intestinal obstruction ) is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines , preventing the normal transit of the products of digestion ."
22128,It can occur at any level distal to the duodenum of the small intestine and is a medical emergency .
22129,The condition is often treated conservatively over a period of 2–5 days with the patient 's progress regularly monitored by an assigned physician .
22130,"Surgical procedures are performed on occasion however in life-threatening cases , such as when the root cause is a fully lodged foreign object or malignant tumor ."
22131,Squirrels belong to a large family of small or medium-sized rodents called the Sciuridae .
22132,"The family includes tree squirrels , ground squirrels , chipmunks , marmots ( including woodchucks ) , flying squirrels , and prairie dogs ."

22134,The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among living rodent families .
22135,A diplexer is a passive device that implements frequency domain multiplexing .
22136,"Two ports ( e.g. , L and H ) are multiplexed onto a third port ( e.g. , S ) ."
22137,The signals on ports L and H occupy disjoint frequency bands .
22138,"Consequently , the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other ."
22139,"Typically , the signal on port L will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band ."
22140,"In that situation , the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports L and S and high pass filter connecting ports H and S. Ideally , all the signal power on port L is transferred to the S port and vice versa ."
22141,All the signal power on port H is transferred to port S and vice versa .
22142,"Ideally , the separation of the signals is complete ."
22143,None of the low band signal is transferred from the S port to the H port .
22144,"In the real world , some power will be lost , and some signal power will leak to the wrong port ."
22145,Television diplexer consisting of a high-pass filter ( left ) and a low-pass filter ( right ) .
22146,The antenna is connected to the screw terminals to the left of center .
22147,"The diplexer , being a passive device , is reciprocal : the device itself does n't have a notion of input or output ."
22148,The diplexer is a different device than a passive combiner or splitter .
22149,The ports of a diplexer are frequency selective ; the ports of a combiner are not .
22150,There is also a power `` loss '' difference - a combiner takes all the power delivered to the S port and equally divides it between the A and B ports .
22151,A diplexer does not .
22152,"A diplexer multiplexes two ports onto one port , but more than two ports may be multiplexed : a three-port to one-port multiplexer is known as a triplexer ."
22153,"The American frontier comprises the geography , history , folklore , and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of American westward expansion that began with English colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the assimilation of the last mainland territories into states in the early 20th century ."
22154,"Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the western United States in the second half of the nineteenth century , a period sometimes called the Old West , or the Wild West ."
22155,"As defined by Hine and Faragher , `` frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities , the use of the land , the development of markets , and the formation of states . ''"
22156,"They explain , `` It is a tale of conquest , but also one of survival , persistence , and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America . ''"
22157,"Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes , political compromise , military conquest , establishment of law and order , building farms , ranches and towns , marking trails and digging mines , and pulling in great migrations of foreigners , the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of Manifest destiny ."
22158,"Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in his `` Frontier thesis `` ( 1893 ) theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people , the Americans , whose values focused on equality , democracy , and optimism , as well as individualism , self-reliance and violence ."
22159,"As the American frontier passed into history , the myths of the West in fiction and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike ."
22160,America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image .
22161,"`` No other nation , '' says David Murdoch , `` has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America’s creation of the West . ''"
22162,"The Asus Eee PC is a netbook computer line from ASUSTeK Computer Incorporated , and a part of the Asus Eee product family ."
22163,"At the time of its introduction in late 2007 , it was noted for its combination of a light weight , Linux -based operating system , solid-state drive ( SSD ) , and relatively low cost ."
22164,"Newer models added the options of Microsoft Windows operating system , rotating media hard disk drives ( HDD ) and initially retailed for up to 500 euros ."
22165,"The first Eee PC was a milestone in the personal computer business , launching the netbook category of small , low cost laptops in the West ( in Japan , subnotebooks had long been a staple in computing ) ."
22166,"According to Asus , the name Eee derives from `` the three Es '' , an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device : `` Easy to learn , Easy to work , Easy to play '' ."
22167,"In January 2013 , Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks ."

22172,"Here , the fastest winds are colored red ; slower winds are blue ."
22173,Clouds along a jet stream over Canada .
22174,Jet streams flow from west to east in the upper portion of the troposphere .
22175,"Jet streams are fast flowing , narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets , including Earth ."
22176,"The main jet streams are located near the tropopause , the transition between the troposphere ( where temperature decreases with altitude ) and the stratosphere ( where temperature increases with altitude ) ."
22177,The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds ( flowing west to east ) .
22178,"Their paths typically have a meandering shape ; jet streams may start , stop , split into two or more parts , combine into one stream , or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet ."
22179,"The strongest jet streams are the polar jets , at around above sea level , and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around ."
22180,The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet .
22181,"The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America , Europe , and Asia and their intervening oceans , while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round ."
22182,"Jet streams are caused by a combination of a planet 's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating ( by solar radiation and , on some planets other than Earth , internal heat ) ."
22183,"Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature , such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator ."
22184,Other jet streams also exist .
22185,"During the northern hemisphere summer , easterly jets can form in tropical regions , typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes ."
22186,Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States .
22187,Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting .
22188,"The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel , as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream ."

22406,"Independent stock transfer agents are independent of large banks , but are fully capable of servicing even the largest companies , often at far less cost ."
22407,"Stock transfer agents also run annual meetings as inspector of elections , proxy voting , and special meetings of shareholders ."
22408,They are considered the official keeper of the corporate shareholder records .
22409,"The guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also called the cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia ."
22410,"Despite their common name , these animals are not in the pig family , nor are they from Guinea ."
22411,"They originated in the Andes , and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea , C. fulgida , or C. tschudii and , therefore , do not exist naturally in the wild ."
22412,"Recent studies applying molecular markers , in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii ."
22413,"The guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups , especially as a food source , but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies ."
22414,"Since the 1960s , efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America ."
22415,"In Western societies , the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century ."
22416,"Their docile nature , their responsiveness to handling and feeding , and the relative ease of caring for them , continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet ."
22417,"Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide , and many specialized breeds of guinea pig , with varying coat colors and compositions , are cultivated by breeders ."
22418,Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century .
22419,"The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries , resulting in the epithet `` guinea pig '' for a test subject , but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats ."
22420,"They are still used in research , primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes , tuberculosis , scurvy , and pregnancy complications ."
22421,"Love Canal was a neighborhood in Niagara Falls , New York , located in the LaSalle section of the city ."
22422,"It officially covers 36 square blocks in the far southeastern corner of the city , along 99th Street and Read Avenue ."
22423,Two bodies of water define the northern and southern boundaries of the neighborhood : Bergholtz Creek to the north and the Niagara River one-quarter mile ( 400 m ) to the south .
22424,"In the mid-1970s Love Canal became the subject of national and international attention after it was revealed in the press that the site had formerly been used to bury 21,000 tons of toxic waste by Hooker Chemical ( now Occidental Petroleum Corporation ) ."
22425,"Hooker Chemical sold the site to the Niagara Falls School Board in 1953 for $ 1 , with a deed explicitly detailing the presence of the waste , and including a liability limitation clause about the contamination ."
22426,"The construction efforts of housing development , combined with particularly heavy rainstorms , released the chemical waste , leading to a public health emergency and an urban planning scandal ."
22427,"Hooker Chemical was found to be negligent in their disposal of waste , though not reckless in the sale of the land , in what became a test case for liability clauses ."
22428,"The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper , the Niagara Falls Gazette , from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978 ."
22429,Potential health problems were first raised by reporter Michael H. Brown in July 1978 .
22430,"Ten years after the incident , New York State Health Department Commissioner David Axelrod ( not to be confused with presidential advisor David Axelrod ) stated that Love Canal would long be remembered as a `` national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations . ''"
22431,The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants `` overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around . ''
22432,The Great Sphinx and the pyramids of Giza are among the most recognizable symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt .
22433,"Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa , concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt ."
22434,Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC ( according to conventional Egyptian chronology ) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh .
22435,"The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms , separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods : the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age , the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age ."
22436,"Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom , in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the Hittite Empire , Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire , after which it entered a period of slow decline ."
22437,"Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers ( such as the Canaanites / Hyksos , Libyans , Nubians , Assyria , Babylonia , Persian rule and Macedonian Greece ) in the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt and Late Period ."
22438,"In the aftermath of Alexander the Great 's death , one of his generals , Ptolemy Soter , established himself as the new ruler of Egypt ."
22439,"This Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty ruled Egypt until 30 BC , when , under Cleopatra , it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province ."
22440,The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley .
22441,"The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops , which fueled social development and culture ."
22442,"With resources to spare , the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions , the early development of an independent writing system , the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects , trade with surrounding regions , and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance ."
22443,"Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes , religious leaders , and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs ."
22444,"The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying , surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental pyramids , temples , and obelisks ; a system of mathematics , a practical and effective system of medicine , irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques , the first known ships , Egyptian faience and glass technology , new forms of literature , and the earliest known peace treaty with Hittites ."
22445,Egypt left a lasting legacy .
22446,"Its art and architecture were widely copied , and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world ."
22447,Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries .
22448,A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy .

22455,This article is about the ballpark which opened in 2009 .
22456,"For the original stadium , on the south side of 161st Street , go to Yankee Stadium ( 1923 ) ."
22457,Yankee Stadium is a stadium located in The Bronx in New York City .
22458,"It is the home ballpark for the New York Yankees , one of the city 's Major League Baseball ( MLB ) franchises ."
22459,"It opened at the beginning of the 2009 MLB season as a replacement for the team 's previous home , the original Yankee Stadium , which opened in 1923 and closed in 2008 ."
22460,"The new ballpark was constructed across the street , north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium , on the former site of Macombs Dam Park ."
22461,"The ballpark opened April 2 , 2009 , when the Yankees hosted a workout day in front of fans from the Bronx community ."
22462,"The first game at the new Yankee Stadium was a pre-season exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs played on April 3 , 2009 , which the Yankees won 7–4 ."
22463,"The first regular season game was played on April 16 , a 10–2 Yankee loss to the Cleveland Indians ."
22464,"Much of the stadium incorporates design elements from the previous Yankee Stadium , thus paying homage to Yankee history ."
22465,"Although stadium construction began in August 2006 , the project of building a new stadium for the Yankees is one that spanned many years and faced many controversies ."
22466,The stadium was built on what had been of public parkland .
22467,Replacement baseball fields opened in April 2012 .
22468,"Also controversial was the price tag of $ 1.5 billion , which makes it not only the most expensive baseball stadium ever built , but the second-most expensive stadium of any kind ( after MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey ) ."

22473,"From left to right : Molex Mini-fit Jr 20 and 4 pin , Molex KK , SATA connector , Molex 8981 and Molex mini-spox ."
22474,"Molex connector is the vernacular term for a two-piece pin and socket interconnection , most frequently disk drive connectors ."
22475,"Pioneered by Molex Connector Company , the two-piece design became an early electronic standard ."
22476,Molex developed and patented the first examples of this connector style in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
22477,"First used in home appliances , other industries soon began designing it into their products from automobiles to vending machines to mini-computers ."
22478,"In such a connector , cylindrical spring-metal pins fit into cylindrical spring-metal sockets ."
22479,The pins and sockets are held in a rectangular matrix in a nylon shell .
22480,The connector typically has two to 24 contacts and is polarized or keyed to ensure correct orientation .
22481,"Pins and sockets can be arranged in any combination in a single housing , and each housing can be either male or female ."
22482,"There are three typical pin sizes : , , and ."
22483,"The 1.57 mm pin can carry 5 A of current , while the 2.36 mm can carry 8.5 A ."
22484,"Because the pins have a large contact surface area and fit tightly , these connectors are typically used for power ."
22485,"This style of connector was first used as a computer disk drive connector in the late 1970s , initially on the Shugart floppy disk drive as well as Atari ( 1979 ) on its path to becoming a de facto standard ."
22486,It is in this role that the vernacular term molex connector is most frequently used .
22487,AMP ( now a division of Tyco International ) developed the MATE-N-LOK 2.13 mm pin connector that is the same as the Molex 8981 power connector .
22488,This Molex and Amp connector configuration was the established standard for disk drive power connectors until the introduction of SATA disk drives .
22489,Ferris Bueller 's Day Off is a 1986 American coming of age comedy film written and directed by John Hughes .
22490,"The film follows high school senior Ferris Bueller ( Matthew Broderick ) , who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago ."
22491,"Accompanied by his girlfriend Sloane Peterson ( Mia Sara ) and his best friend Cameron Frye ( Alan Ruck ) , he creatively avoids his school 's Dean of Students Edward Rooney ( Jeffrey Jones ) , his resentful sister Jeanie ( Jennifer Grey ) , and his parents ."
22492,"During the film , Bueller frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera to explain to the audience his techniques and thoughts ."
22493,Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week and shot the film—on a budget of $ 5.8 million—over several months in late 1985 .
22494,"Featuring many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago , the film was Hughes ' love letter to the city : `` I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could ."
22495,"Not just in the architecture and landscape , but the spirit . ''"
22496,"Released by Paramount Pictures on June 11 , 1986 , Ferris Bueller 's Day Off became one of the top grossing films of the year and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences alike ."
22497,"`` Singles Awareness ( or Appreciation ) Day '' ( S.A.D . ) is a humorous holiday , celebrated on February 14 ( although some prefer the 13th or the 15th to get away from the commercialism associated with the 14th ) ."
22498,"It serves as an alternative to Valentine 's Day for people who are single , that is , not involved in a romantic relationship ."
22499,"Some people who observe S.A.D . do so out of spite for Valentine 's Day , as a Hallmark holiday , or for other reasons ."
22500,"On Singles Awareness Day , single people gather to celebrate or to commiserate in their single status ."
22501,Some want to remind romantic couples that they do n't need to be in a relationship to celebrate life .
22502,"Common activities during Singles Awareness Day include , single events , traveling , volunteering , treating oneself to popular activities , gathering of family and friends , and gift giving for oneself ."
22503,"One increasingly popular activity is to travel to Brazil and witness the Brazilian Carnival , coupled with the fact that Brazil does n't celebrate Valentine 's Day on February 14 , but in June ."
22504,Both factors provide a temporary getaway from the Valentine 's holiday and substitute it with another celebration .
22505,"On this day many people wear green , as it is considered to be the 'opposite ' of red ."
22506,"Another popular option is an absence of color ( black ) , to symbolize an absence of celebration ."
22507,"The Temple Owls are the athletic teams representing Temple University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ."
22508,The school 's sports teams are called the Owls .
22509,The current athletic director is Bill Bradshaw .
22510,The owl has been the symbol and mascot for Temple University since its founding in the 1880s .
22511,Temple was the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol or mascot .
22512,"The owl , a nocturnal hunter , was initially adopted as a symbol because Temple University began as a night school for young people of limited means ."
22513,"Russell Conwell , Temple 's founder , encouraged these students with the remark : `` The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day . ''"
22514,"Samuel Ruben ( born Charles Rubenstein , November 5 , 1913 – September 28 , 1943 ) , the son of Herschel and Frieda Penn Rubenstein – the name was officially shortened to Ruben in 1930 ."
22515,"Young Sam developed a friendship with neighbor Jack Dempsey and became involved with a local boys ' boxing club and later , when the family moved across the Bay to Berkeley , he was a successful basketball player at Berkeley High School ( Berkeley , California ) ."
22516,"After achieving his B.S . in Chemistry at the University of California , Berkeley , he continued his studies there and was awarded a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in May 1938 ."
22517,"He was immediately appointed Instructor in the Chemistry Department , and became an Assistant Professor in 1941 ."
22518,"Sam and colleague Martin Kamen , a University of Chicago Ph.D. and researcher in chemistry and nuclear physics working under Ernest O. Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , set out to elucidate the path of carbon in photosynthesis by incorporating the short-lived radioactive isotope Carbon-11 ( 11CO2 ) in their many experiments between 1938 and 1942 ."
22519,"Aided by the concepts and collaboration of C. B. van Niel , at Stanford University ’s Hopkins Marine Station , it became clear to them that reduction of CO2 can occur in the dark and may involve processes similar to bacterial systems ."
22520,"This interpretation challenged the century-old Adolf von Baeyer theory of photochemical reduction of CO2 adsorbed on chlorophyll which had guided decades of effort by Richard Willstätter , A. Stoll , and many others in vain searches for formaldehyde ."
22521,"In hundreds of experiments with Carbon-11 produced from deuterons and Boron-10 by Martin Kamen in the Radiation Laboratory’s 37-inch cyclotron , Ruben and Kamen , with collaborators from botany , microbiology , physiology and organic chemistry , pursued the path of carbon dioxide in plants , algae , and bacteria ."
22522,"Their results , confused by absorption of the products on proteinaceous residues , initially failed to reveal the path of carbon in photosynthesis but succeeded in exciting the interest of scientists worldwide in the search and revelation of metabolic processes , beginning a revolution in biochemistry and medicine ."
22523,"Ruben’s experiments using 'heavy water ' , H2O18 , to yield 18O2 gas had shown that the oxygen gas produced in photosynthesis comes from water ."
22524,"With nuclear physicists ' tenuous prediction of a `` long lived radioactive carbon isotope , ” Ruben and Kamen pursued several routes that could lead to identification of the Carbon-14 isotope ."
22525,"After several failed attempts , Martin Kamen collected the results of a 120-hour cyclotron bombardment of graphite and trudged in the rain with it to the “Rat House , ” adjacent both to the Chemistry Department and to the cyclotron , and Sam Ruben 's desk ."
22526,"At 8 AM , February 27 , 1940 , Sam Ruben demonstrated unequivocally the radioactivity was from Carbon-14 ."
22527,The weak energy of Carbon-14 made measurement tedious .
22528,So tedious that no tracer experiments with C-14 were done until 1942 when Sam Ruben gave all his barium carbonate-C14 to young Chemistry Department faculty member Andrew Benson who began his long series of 14CO2 fixation experiments to determine the path of carbon in photosynthesis .
22529,Only in 1949 did chemist Willard Libby use it to invent radiocarbon dating .
22530,Ruben 's recruitment for research in the World War II wartime effort led him to interest in the mechanism of phosgene as a poisonous gas .
22531,"With C-11 phosgene ( 11COCl2 ) prepared by Benson , they studied the combination of phosgene with lung proteins ."
22532,"Following Benson 's departure from Berkeley in July 1943 , Ruben died September 28 , 1943 after a disastrous exposure to phosgene in a laboratory accident the preceding day ."
22533,"Sam Ruben married Helena Collins West , a fellow chemistry student , during his final semester as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley , on September 28 , 1935 ."
22534,"They had three children , Dana West Ruben ( born November 11 , 1938 ) , George Collins Ruben ( born April 29 , 1941 , and Connie Mae Ruben Fatt ( born June 18 , 1943 ) ."
22535,The Starving Time at Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610 in which all but 60 of 500 colonists died .
22536,"The colonists , the first group of whom had originally arrived at Jamestown on May 14 , 1607 , had never planned to grow all of their own food ."
22537,Their plans depended upon trade with the local Native Americans ' Powhatan Confederacy to supply them with food between the arrivals of periodic supply ships from England .
22538,Lack of access to water and a relatively dry rain season crippled the agricultural production of the colonists .
22539,"Also , the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year ."
22540,"A fleet from England , damaged by a hurricane , arrived months behind schedule with new colonists , but without expected food supplies ."
22541,"On June 7 , 1610 the survivors boarded ships , abandoned the colony site , and sailed towards the Chesapeake Bay , where another supply convoy with new supplies and headed by a newly appointed governor , Thomas West , Baron De La Warr , intercepted them on the lower James River and returned them to Jamestown ."
22542,"Within a few years , the commercialization of tobacco by John Rolfe secured the settlement 's long-term economic prosperity ."
22543,There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time .
22544,"Culture ( , lit ."
22545,"`` cultivation '' ) is a modern concept based on a term first used in classical antiquity by the Roman orator , Cicero : `` cultura animi '' ."
22546,"The term `` culture '' appeared first in its current sense in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries , to connote a process of cultivation or improvement , as in agriculture or horticulture ."
22547,"In the 19th century , the term developed to refer first to the betterment or refinement of the individual , especially through education , and then to the fulfillment of national aspirations or ideals ."
22548,"In the mid-19th century , some scientists used the term `` culture '' to refer to a universal human capacity ."
22549,"For the German nonpositivist sociologist Georg Simmel , culture referred to `` the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history '' ."
22550,"In the 20th century , `` culture '' emerged as a central concept in anthropology , encompassing the range of human phenomena that can not be attributed to genetic inheritance ."
22551,"Specifically , the term `` culture '' in American anthropology had two meanings : ( 1 ) the evolved human capacity to classify and represent experiences with symbols , and to act imaginatively and creatively ; and ( 2 ) the distinct ways that people living in different parts of the world classified and represented their experiences , and acted creatively ."
22552,Hoebel describes culture as an integrated system of learned behavior patterns which are characteristic of the members of a society and which are not a result of biological inheritance .
22553,"Distinctions are currently made between the physical artifacts created by a society , its so-called material culture and everything else , the intangibles such as language , customs , etc . that are the main referent of the term `` culture '' ."
22554,"In this article , inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies of British America that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as `` Americans , '' with occasional references to `` Patriots , '' `` Whigs , '' `` Rebels '' or `` Revolutionaries . ''"
22555,Colonists who supported the British in opposing the Revolution are usually referred to as `` Loyalists `` or `` Tories . ''
22556,The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as `` America '' .

22558,"The American Revolution was a political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break from the British Empire , combining to become the United States of America ."
22559,"They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation , and then expelled all royal officials ."
22560,"By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress or an equivalent governmental institution to govern itself , but still recognized the British Crown and their inclusion in the empire ."
22561,The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule .
22562,"Through the Second Continental Congress , the Americans then managed the armed conflict in response to the British known as the American Revolutionary War ( also : American War of Independence , 1775–83 ) ."
22563,The British sent invasion armies and used their powerful navy to blockade the coast .
22564,"George Washington became the American commander , working with Congress and the states to raise armies and neutralize the influence of Loyalists ."
22565,"Claiming the rule of George III of Great Britain was tyrannical and therefore illegitimate , Congress declared independence as a new nation in July 1776 , when Thomas Jefferson wrote and the states unanimously ratified the United States Declaration of Independence ."
22566,"The British lost Boston in 1776 , but then captured and held New York City ."
22567,"The British would capture the revolutionary capital at Philadelphia in 1777 , but Congress escaped , and the British withdrew a few months later ."

22570,"A peace treaty in 1783 confirmed the new nation 's complete separation from the British Empire , and resulted in the United States taking possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River ."
22571,"The American Revolution was the result of a series of social , political , and intellectual transformations in American society , government and ways of thinking ."
22572,"Americans rejected the aristocracies that dominated Europe at the time , championing instead the development of republicanism based on the Enlightenment understanding of liberalism ."
22573,Virtue was the goal and corruption was the enemy .
22574,Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government responsible to the will of the people .
22575,"However , sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of democracy desirable in the new government , with a number of Founders fearing mob rule ."
22576,"Fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788 , which replaced the weaker Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ."
22577,"In contrast to the loose confederation , the Constitution established a relatively stronger federal national government ."
22578,"The United States Bill of Rights of 1791 is the first ten amendments to the Constitution , guaranteeing many `` natural rights `` that were influential in justifying the revolution , and attempted to balance a strong national government with strong state governments and broad personal liberties ."
22579,"The American shift to liberal republicanism , and the gradually increasing democracy , caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States ."

22586,"Set between 1839 and 1889 , it follows four generations of a family ( starting as the Prescotts ) as they move ever westward , from western New York state to the Pacific Ocean ."
22587,The picture was filmed in the curved-screen three-projector Cinerama process .
22588,The fundamental idea behind the film was to provide an episodic retelling of the progress of westward migration and development of America .
22589,"It was inspired by a much longer and more complex series of historical narratives that appeared as a photo essay series , by the same name , three years earlier in Life magazine , which is acknowledged in the film’s credits ."

22612,"Euphemisms and terms for old people include seniors ( American usage ) , senior citizens ( British and American usage ) , older adults ( in the social sciences ) , the elderly , and elders ( in many cultures including the cultures of aboriginal people ) ."
22613,"Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more prone to disease , syndromes , and sickness than younger adults ."
22614,"For the biology of ageing , see senescence ."
22615,"The medical study of the aging process is gerontology , and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is geriatrics ."

22627,"At the 2008 Television Critics Association , it was announced that Weeds had been picked up for fifth and sixth seasons of 13 episodes each ."
22628,"An eighth and final season premiered in July 1 , 2012 and concluded September 16 , 2012 ."
22629,"At the completion of the sixth season , Jenji Kohan remarked that , “In my mind , it is [ the last season ] ."
22630,"Everyone’s contract is up next year , [ including ] the actors and mine ."
22631,"Seven years is a good run , and I’d rather leave while on top.”"
22632,"However , halfway through the seventh-season run , Showtime Entertainment president David Nevins remarked that he is “optimistic” that the show will be renewed ."
22633,Kohan also expressed hope that the show would be renewed .
22634,"Regardless of renewal , the seventh-season finale was crafted to “stand up on its own as a series finale if it has to or be a prelude to an eighth season.”"
22635,"An eighth season was announced in November 2011 , almost two months after the seventh season finale ."
22636,"On June 13 , 2012 it was announced that season eight would be the final season ."
22637,Weeds has steadily gained live viewers from season to season .
22638,"The first season premiered to 540,000 viewers and averaged 380,000 viewers to become Showtime 's highest-rated original series in 2005 ."

22644,A graduate school is a school that awards advanced academic degrees ( i.e . master 's and doctoral degrees ) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate ( bachelor 's ) degree .
22645,"A distinction is typically made between graduate schools ( where courses of study do not provide training for a particular profession ) and professional schools , which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine , business , engineering , ministry or law ."
22646,Many universities award graduate degrees ; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution .
22647,"While the term `` graduate school '' is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere ( e.g. , the UK and Canada ) , `` postgraduate education `` is also used in some English-speaking countries ( Australia , Canada , Ireland , India , New Zealand , Pakistan and the UK ) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor 's degree ."
22648,"Those attending graduate schools are called `` graduate students '' ( in both American and British English ) , or often in British English as `` postgraduate students '' and , colloquially , `` postgraduates '' and `` postgrads '' ."
22649,"Degrees awarded to graduate students include master 's degrees , doctoral degrees , and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees ."
22650,"Producing original research is often a significant component of graduate studies , including the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation ."
22651,The term `` graduate school '' is primarily North American .
22652,"Additionally , in North America , the term does not usually refer to medical school ( whose students are called `` medical students '' ) , and only occasionally refers to law school or business school ."
22653,( The latter types of programs are often collectively termed professional schools ) .
22654,"Although graduate school programs are distinct experiences from undergraduate degree programs , graduate instruction ( in Australia , the United States , and other countries ) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses ."
22655,"Unlike in undergraduate programs , however , it is rare for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level ."
22656,"At the Ph.D. level , though , it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study , for which some fixed portion of coursework , sometimes known as a residency , is typically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the degree-seeking candidate , to broaden the research abilities of the student ."
22657,"Some institutions designate separate graduate versus undergraduate staff and denote other divisions ( often called School of X , e.g. , diplomacy )"
22658,"Thank Me Later is the debut studio album by Canadian recording artist Drake , released on June 15 , 2010 , by Young Money Entertainment , Cash Money Records , and Universal Motown Records ."
22659,Production for the album took place at various recording studios during 2009 to 2010 and was mostly produced by longtime collaborators Noah `` 40 '' Shebib and Boi-1da .
22660,"It also featured contributions from Timbaland , Swizz Beatz , Nicki Minaj , Lil Wayne , The-Dream , and Kanye West , among others ."
22661,"Thank Me Later has a languorous , ambient production that incorporates moody synthesizers , sparse beats , obscured keyboards , minor keys , and subtle arrangements ."
22662,"Thematically , the album focuses on Drake 's introduction to fame and his romances over the course of confessional , club-oriented , and sexual songs ."
22663,"Drake 's emotionally transparent , self-deprecating lyrics are delivered in both rapped and subtly sung verses , and explore feelings of doubt , insecurity , and heartbreak ."
22664,"Upon its release , the album received generally positive reviews from music critics , who complimented Drake 's personal themes and drew musical comparisons to the works of hip hop artists Kanye West and Kid Cudi ."
22665,"Following an anticipated release , it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 on first-week sales of 447,000 copies , and attained platinum certification in Canada within its debut week ."
22666,"All four of the album 's singles became hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , including the top-10 hit `` Find Your Love `` ."
22667,"Thank Me Later was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and , as of February 2012 , has sold 1,551,000 copies in the US ."
22668,"Blood type ( or blood group ) is determined , in part , by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells ."
22669,A blood type ( also called a blood group ) is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells ( RBCs ) .
22670,"These antigens may be proteins , carbohydrates , glycoproteins , or glycolipids , depending on the blood group system ."
22671,Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues .
22672,Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one allele ( or very closely linked genes ) and collectively form a blood group system .
22673,Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents .
22674,A total of 32 human blood group systems are now recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion ( ISBT ) .
22675,"There exist 4 major blood types ; O , A , AB and B ."
22676,"These can be further subdivided into +/- ( i.e. , O+ , A– ) , denoting the presence or absence of Rh antigen ."
22677,"Many pregnant women carry a fetus with a blood type different from their own , and the mother can form antibodies against fetal RBCs ."
22678,"Sometimes these maternal antibodies are IgG , a small immunoglobulin , which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs , which in turn can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn called erythroblastosis fetalis , an illness of low fetal blood counts that ranges from mild to severe ."
22679,Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus ; in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis .
22680,"The USCG Utility Boat , or UTB , is a standard utility boat used by the United States Coast Guard for a variety of inshore missions ."
22681,The 41 ft ( 12 m ) UTB is designed to operate under moderate weather and sea conditions where its speed and maneuverability make it an ideal platform .
22682,There are presently 172 operational boats .
22683,"Currently these boats are being phased out , although many will remain in operation for several years to come ."
22684,"The boats are welded 5086 aluminum , with a molded fiberglass superstructure and twin Cummins diesel engines with conventional shafts and propellers ."
22685,"They are capable of light towing , and were originally fitted with demountable fire monitors , although most have been removed ."
22686,Typical boat crew is 3 .
22687,"They were constructed at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore , Maryland , from 1972 to 1979 ."
22688,"Beginning in 2008 , these aging boats will be retired and replaced with the Response Boat-Medium over a 6–10 year period ."
22689,"This is a list of Star Wars novels , novellas , and short stories ."
22690,Beginning with the release of Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace Lucasfilm has divided their titles into different eras with symbols designating such .

22700,"Great Britain ( , , , ) , also known as Britain , is an island to the north-west of Continental Europe ."
22701,"It is the ninth largest island in the world , the largest European island and the largest of the British Isles ."
22702,"With a population of about 62 million people in mid-2010 , it is the third most populous island in the world , after Java and Honshū ."
22703,"It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets ."
22704,The island of Ireland lies to its west .
22705,"Politically , Great Britain also refers to the island itself together with a number of surrounding islands , which constitute the territory of England , Scotland and Wales ."
22706,"All of the island is territory of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and most of the United Kingdom 's territory is in Great Britain ."
22707,"Most of England , Scotland , and Wales are on the island of Great Britain , as are their respective capital cities : London , Edinburgh , and Cardiff ."
22708,The Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland with the Acts of Union 1707 on 1 May 1707 under Queen Anne .
22709,"In 1801 , under a new Act of Union , this kingdom merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ."
22710,"After the Irish War of Independence ( 1919–1921 ) most of Ireland seceded from the Union , which then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ."
22711,The variety of fauna and flora is limited in comparison to continental Europe due to the island 's size and the fact that wildlife has had little time to develop since the last glacial period .
22712,For fungi there is not sufficient information available for meaningful comparisons to be made .
22713,The high level of urbanisation on the island has contributed to a species extinction rate that is about 100 times greater than the background species extinction rate .

22715,Seawater is water from a sea or ocean .
22716,"On average , seawater in the world 's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5 % ( 35 g/L , or 599 mM ) ."
22717,This means that every kilogram ( roughly one litre by volume ) of seawater has approximately of dissolved salts ( predominantly sodium ( ) and chloride ( ) ions ) .
22718,Average density at the surface is 1.025 g / ml .
22719,Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water ( density 1.0 g/ml @ ) because the dissolved salts add mass without contributing significantly to the volume .
22720,The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases .
22721,At typical salinity it freezes at about .
22722,"The coldest seawater ever recorded ( in a liquid state ) was in 2010 , in a stream under an Antarctic glacier , and measured ."
22723,"Seville ( ; , , ) is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of Seville , Spain ."
22724,It is situated on the plain of the River Guadalquivir .
22725,"The inhabitants of the city are known as sevillanos ( feminine form : sevillanas ) or hispalenses , after the Roman name of the city , Hispalis ."
22726,"Seville has a municipal population of about 703,000 as of 2011 , and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million , making it the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union ."
22727,"Its Old Town , the third largest in Europe with an area of 4 km2 , contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Alcázar palace complex , the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies ."
22728,"The Seville harbour , located about 80 km from the Atlantic Ocean , is the only river port in Spain ."
22729,"Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis , and was known as Ishbiliya ( Arabic : ) after the Muslim conquest in 712 ."
22730,"During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of Córdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 ."
22731,"After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contratación ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature ."
22732,"In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth ."
22733,"Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of Cádiz ."
22734,"The 20th century in Seville saw the horrors of the Spanish Civil War , decisive cultural milestones such as the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 and Expo'92 , and the city 's election as the capital of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia ."

22736,The population was 523 at the 2010 Census .
22737,"Connective tissue ( CT ) is a kind of biological tissue that supports , connects , or separates different types of tissues and organs of the body ."
22738,"It is one of the four general classes of biological tissues—the others of which are epithelial , muscular , and nervous tissues ."
22739,"All CT has three main components : cells , fibers , and extracellular matrices , all immersed in the body fluids ."
22740,"Connective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper , special connective tissue , and series of other , less classifiable types of connective tissues ."
22741,Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue ( which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues . )
22742,"Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue , adipose tissue , cartilage , bone , and blood ."
22743,"Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous , elastic , and lymphoid connective tissues ."
22744,Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT .
22745,"Type-I collagen , is present in many forms of connective tissue , and makes up about 25 % of the total protein content of the mammalian body ."
22746,"April is the fourth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars , and one of four months with a length of 30 days ."
22747,"April ( ) is commonly associated with the season of spring in the Northern hemisphere and autumn in the Southern hemisphere , where it is the seasonal equivalent to October in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa ."
22748,"April starts on the same day of the week as July in all years , and January in leap years ."
22749,April ends on the same day of the week as December every year .

22752,"Her ministry is headquartered in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton , Missouri ."
22753,"The Korean War ( Korean : 한국전쟁 or 조선전쟁 ; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953 ) was a war between the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) , supported by the United Nations , and the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , at one time supported by the People 's Republic of China and the Soviet Union ."
22754,It was primarily the result of the political division of Korea by an agreement of the victorious Allies at the conclusion of the Pacific War at the end of World II War II II .
22755,The Korean Peninsula was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1910 until the end of World War II .
22756,"Following the surrender of the Empire of Japan in September 1945 , American administrators divided the peninsula along the 38th parallel , with U.S. military forces occupying the southern half and Soviet military forces occupying the northern half ."
22757,"The failure to hold free elections throughout the Korean Peninsula in 1948 deepened the division between the two sides ; the North established a communist government , while the South established a right-wing government ."
22758,The 38th parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Korean states .
22759,"Although reunification negotiations continued in the months preceding the war , tension intensified ."
22760,Cross-border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel persisted .
22761,The situation escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950 .
22762,"In 1950 , the Soviet Union boycotted the United Nations Security Council , in protest at representation of China by the Kuomintang / Republic of China government , which had taken refuge in Taiwan following defeat in the Chinese Civil War ."
22763,"In the absence of a dissenting voice from the Soviet Union , who could have vetoed it , the United States and other countries passed a Security Council resolution authorizing military intervention in Korea ."
22764,"The United States of America provided 88 % of the 341,000 international soldiers which aided South Korean forces in repelling the invasion , with twenty other countries of the United Nations offering assistance ."
22765,"Suffering severe casualties within the first two months , the defenders were pushed back to a small area in the south of the Korean Peninsula , known as the Pusan perimeter ."
22766,"A rapid U.N. counter-offensive then drove the North Koreans past the 38th Parallel and almost to the Yalu River , when the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) entered the war on the side of North Korea ."
22767,Chinese intervention forced the Southern-allied forces to retreat behind the 38th Parallel .
22768,"While not directly committing forces to the conflict , the Soviet Union provided material aid to both the North Korean and Chinese armies ."
22769,"The fighting ended on 27 July 1953 , when the armistice agreement was signed ."
22770,"The agreement restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) , a -wide fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations ."
22771,Minor incidents still continue today .
22772,"From a military science perspective , it combined strategies and tactics of World War I and World War II : it began with a mobile campaign of swift infantry attacks followed by air bombing raids , but became a static trench war by July 1951 ."
22773,"A continual improvement process , also often called a continuous improvement process ( abbreviated as CIP or CI ) , is an ongoing effort to improve products , services , or processes ."
22774,These efforts can seek `` incremental '' improvement over time or `` breakthrough '' improvement all at once .
22775,"Delivery ( customer valued ) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency , effectiveness and flexibility ."
22776,"Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems ( such as business process management , quality management , project management , and program management ) ."
22777,"W. Edwards Deming , a pioneer of the field , saw it as part of the 'system ' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals ."
22778,The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management ' ; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself .
22779,"Frank Lloyd Wright ( born Frank Lincoln Wright , June 8 , 1867 – April 9 , 1959 ) was an American architect , interior designer , writer and educator , who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 532 works ."
22780,"Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment , a philosophy he called organic architecture ."
22781,"This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called `` the best all-time work of American architecture '' ."
22782,"Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States ."
22783,"His work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types , including offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , and museums ."
22784,"Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings , such as the furniture and stained glass ."
22785,Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe .
22786,"His colorful personal life often made headlines , most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio ."
22787,"Already well known during his lifetime , Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as `` the greatest American architect of all time . ''"
22788,"A medieval ship flag captured by forces from Lübeck in the 1420s showed the arms of Denmark , Sweden , Norway and Pomerania ."
22789,"The original flag was destroyed during a World War II attack on the city , but a 19th century copy remains in Frederiksborg Palace , Denmark ."
22790,"The saint accompanying the Virgin Mary and infant Christ is Saint James the Greater , identified by his scallop shell emblem ."
22791,"A maritime flag is a flag designated for use on ships , boats , and other watercraft ."
22792,Naval flags are considered important at sea and the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced .
22793,The flag flown is related to the country of registration : so much so that the word `` flag '' is often used symbolically as a synonym for `` country of registration '' .
22794,"Points , sometimes also called a `` discount point '' , are a form of pre-paid interest ."
22795,One point equals one percent of the loan amount .
22796,"By charging a borrower points , a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate ."
22797,"Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan , thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment ."
22798,"For each point purchased , the loan rate is typically reduced by 1/8 % ( 0.125 % ) ."
22799,Paying Points represent a calculated gamble on the part of the buyer .
22800,There will be a specific point in the timeline of the loan where the money spent to buy down the interest rate will be equal to the money saved by making reduced loan payments resulting from the lower interest rate on the loan .
22801,Selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer .
22802,"The longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points , the more the money spent on the points will pay off ."
22803,"Accordingly , if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion , buying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate ."
22804,Points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan .
22805,"Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate , thereby reducing the monthly loan payment ."
22806,Discount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee .
22807,"Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates , while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate ."
22808,Origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement .
22809,The difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower .
22810,"If you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time , it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate ."
22811,Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final good faith estimate ( GFE ) .
22812,Also directly related to points is the concept of the ' no closing cost loan ' .
22813,"If points are paid to acquire a loan , it is impossible at the same time for a broker bank or lender to make a premium for a higher rate ."
22814,"When premium is earned by making the note rate higher , this premium is sometimes used to pay the closing costs ."
22815,"311 ( pronounced `` three-eleven '' ) is an American rock band from Omaha , Nebraska ."
22816,"The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist/guitarist Nick Hexum , lead guitarist Jim Watson ( who would later be replaced by Tim Mahoney ) , bassist Aaron `` P-Nut '' Wills and drummer Chad Sexton ."
22817,"In 1992 , Doug `` SA '' Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311 's later albums , rounding out the current line-up ."
22818,"311 is generally known as an alternative rock band , but it is also classified as rap rock , rap metal , funk rock , funk metal , reggae and jazz fusion ."
22819,"The band 's name originates from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha , Nebraska , after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking ."
22820,"After a series of independent releases , 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music ( 1993 ) and Grassroots ( 1994 ) to moderate success ."
22821,"They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album , which reached No . 12 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles `` Down `` and `` All Mixed Up `` , the former of which topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996 ."
22822,"The band 's next three albums , Transistor ( 1997 ) , Soundsystem ( 1999 ) and From Chaos ( 2001 ) , did not achieve the massive success of the self-titled album , though they were still successful , with the first going platinum and the last two going gold ."
22823,Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits '93–'03 was also certified gold .
22824,The band 's most recent studio album is 2011 's Universal Pulse .

22828,"Denton True `` Cy '' Young ( March 29 , 1867 – November 4 , 1955 ) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher ."
22829,"During his 22-year baseball career ( 1890–1911 ) , he pitched for five different teams ."
22830,"Young established numerous pitching records , some of which have stood for a century ."
22831,"Young compiled 511 wins , which is most in Major League history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson who is second on the list ."
22832,Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937 .
22833,"One year after Young 's death , the Cy Young Award was created to honor the previous season 's best pitcher ."
22834,"In addition to wins , Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched ( 7,355 ) , most career games started ( 815 ) , and most complete games ( 749 ) ."
22835,"He also retired with 316 losses , the most in MLB history ."
22836,Young 's 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time .
22837,"He also won at least 30 games in a season five times , with ten other seasons of 20 or more wins ."
22838,"In addition , Young pitched three no-hitters , including the third perfect game in baseball history , first in baseball 's `` modern era '' ."
22839,"In 1999 , 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death , editors at The Sporting News ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of `` Baseball 's 100 Greatest Players '' ."
22840,"That same year , baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team ."
22841,Young 's career started in 1890 with the Cleveland Spiders .
22842,"After eight years with the Spiders , Young was moved to St. Louis in 1899 ."
22843,"After two years there , Young jumped to the newly-created American League , joining the Boston franchise ."
22844,"He was traded back to Cleveland in 1909 , before spending the final two months of his career with the Boston Rustlers ."
22845,"After his retirement , Young went back to his farm in Ohio , where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955 ."
22846,"A fiscal year ( or financial year , or sometimes budget year ) is a period used for calculating annual ( `` yearly '' ) financial statements in businesses and other organizations ."
22847,"In many jurisdictions , regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months , but do not require that the period reported on constitutes a calendar year ( that is , 1 January to 31 December ) ."
22848,Fiscal years vary between businesses and countries .
22849,The `` fiscal year '' may also refer to the year used for income tax reporting .
22850,"Some companies choose to end their fiscal year on the same day of the week , such day being the one closest to a particular date ( for example , the Friday closest to 31 December ) ."
22851,"Under such a system , some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks ."
22852,Major corporations that adopt this approach include Cisco Systems .
22853,"In the United Kingdom , a number of major corporations that were once government owned , such as BT Group and the National Grid , continue to use the government 's financial year , which ends on the last day of March , as they have found no reason to change since privatisation ."
22854,"Nevertheless , the fiscal year is identical to the calendar year for about 65 % of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK and elsewhere ( with notable exceptions Australia , New Zealand and Japan ) ."
22855,"Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer , both to align the fiscal year with the school year ( and , in some cases involving public universities , with the state government 's fiscal year ) , and because the school is normally less busy during the summer months ."
22856,In the Northern hemisphere this is July in one year to June in the next year .
22857,In the southern hemisphere this is January to December of a single calendar year .
22858,Some media/communication based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year .
22859,"Gertrude Stein , 1935"
22860,"The sentence `` Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose . '' was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem Sacred Emily , which appeared in the 1922 book Geography and Plays ."
22861,"In that poem , the first `` Rose '' is the name of a person ."
22862,"Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings , and `` A rose is a rose is a rose '' is probably her most famous quotation , often interpreted as meaning `` things are what they are , '' a statement of the law of identity , `` A is A '' ."
22863,"In Stein 's view , the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it , an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the rose as an example concept ."
22864,"As the quotation diffused through her own writing , and the culture at large , Stein once remarked `` Now listen !"
22865,I’m no fool .
22866,"I know that in daily life we do n't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ... ' Yes , I’m no fool ; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years . ''"
22867,( Four in America )
22868,She herself said to an audience at Oxford University that the statement referred to the fact that when the Romantics used the word `` rose '' it had a direct relationship to an actual rose .
22869,For later periods in literature this would no longer be true .
22870,"The eras following romanticism , notably the modern era , use the word rose to refer to the actual rose , yet they also imply , through the use of the word , the archetypical elements of the romantic era ."
22871,An embossed foil Notary Seal from the State of New York .
22872,"A notary public ( or notary or public notary ) in the common law world is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates , deeds , powers-of-attorney , and foreign and international business ."
22873,"A notary 's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations , take affidavits and statutory declarations , witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents , take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances , protest notes and bills of exchange , provide notice of foreign drafts , prepare marine or ship 's protests in cases of damage , provide exemplifications and notarial copies , and perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction ."
22874,Any such act is known as a notarization .
22875,The term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries .
22876,"With the exceptions of Louisiana , Puerto Rico , Quebec , whose private law is based on civil law , and British Columbia , whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice , a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries , both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar : such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries ."
22877,"Therefore , at common law , notarial service is distinct from the practice of law , and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States of America ."
22878,"Leaving Las Vegas is a 1995 romantic drama film directed and written by Mike Figgis , based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien ."
22879,Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas .
22880,"While there , he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute , played by Elisabeth Shue , which forms the center of the film ."
22881,O'Brien committed suicide two weeks after production of the film started .
22882,"A halt was considered , but work continued as a tribute ."
22883,"Leaving Las Vegas was filmed in super 16mm instead of 35 mm film which is most commonly used for mainstream film , although 16 mm is common for art house films ."
22884,"After limited release in the United States on October 27 , 1995 , Leaving Las Vegas made its nationwide release on February 9 , 1996 , receiving strong praise from critics and audiences ."
22885,"Cage received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor , while Shue was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress ."
22886,The film also received nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director .

22893,"Police officers buying doughnuts and coffee , an example of perceived stereotypical behavior in North America ."
22894,"A stereotype is a thought that may be adopted about specific types of individuals or certain ways of doing things , but that belief may or may not accurately reflect reality ."
22895,"However , this is only a fundamental psychological definition of a stereotype ."
22896,"Within and across different psychology disciplines , there are different concepts and theories of stereotyping that provide their own expanded definition ."
22897,"Some of these definitions share commonalities , though each one may also harbor unique aspects that may complement or contradict the others ."
22898,The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century .
22899,Plate motion based on Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellite data from NASA JPL .
22900,The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion .
22901,"Remnants of the Farallon Plate , deep in Earth 's mantle ."
22902,"It is thought that much of the plate initially went under North America ( particularly the western United States and southwest Canada ) at a very shallow angle , creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area ( particularly the southern Rocky Mountains ) ."
22903,"Plate tectonics ( from the Late Latin tectonicus , from the `` pertaining to building '' ) is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of Earth 's lithosphere ."
22904,"The model builds on the concepts of continental drift , developed during the first decades of the 20th century ."
22905,It was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
22906,The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates .
22907,"On Earth , there are seven or eight major plates ( depending on how they are defined ) and many minor plates ."
22908,"Where plates meet , their relative motion determines the type of boundary : convergent , divergent , or transform ."
22909,"Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain -building , and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries ."
22910,The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually .
22911,"Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere , each topped by its own kind of crust ."
22912,"Along convergent boundaries , subduction carries plates into the mantle ; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new ( oceanic ) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading ."
22913,"In this way , the total surface of the globe remains the same ."
22914,This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle .
22915,Earlier theories ( that still have some supporters ) proposed gradual shrinking ( contraction ) or gradual expansion of the globe .
22916,Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth 's lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere .
22917,Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection .
22918,"Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge ( due to variations in topography and density of the crust , which result in differences in gravitational forces ) and drag , downward suction , at the subduction zones ."
22919,Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon .
22920,"The relative importance of each of these factors is unclear , and is still subject to debate ( see also below ) ."
22921,"South America , earlier known simply as America ( 1507–1538 ) , is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere , mostly in the Southern Hemisphere , with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere ."
22922,It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas .
22923,It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean ; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest .
22924,"It includes twelve sovereign states – Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay , and Venezuela – and two non-sovereign areas – French Guiana , an overseas region of France , and the Falkland Islands , a British Overseas Territory ."
22925,"In addition to this , Trinidad and Tobago and the ABC islands of the Netherlands may also be considered part of South America ."
22926,"South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers ( 6,890,000 sq mi ) ."
22927,"Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000 ."
22928,"South America ranks fourth in area ( after Asia , Africa , and North America ) and fifth in population ( after Asia , Africa , Europe , and North America ) ."
22929,Most of the population lives near the western or eastern coasts of the continent while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated .
22930,"The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains , in contrast to the eastern large river basins in the Amazon , Paraná and Orinoco ."
22931,Most of the continent lies in the tropics .
22932,"The continent is culturally , ethnically and racially diverse ; hosting cultures and peoples originating in South America as well as Europe , Africa and Asia ."
22933,Given a history of colonialism most South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese and societies and states are commonly modeled after Western traditions .
22934,"Child care or day care is the care of a child during the day by a person other than the child 's legal guardians , typically performed by someone outside the child 's immediate family ."
22935,"Day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods , such as the parents ' time at work ."
22936,The service is known as child care in the United Kingdom and Australia and child care or day care in North America ( although child care also has a broader meaning ) .
22937,Child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a nanny or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes .
22938,"It can also take on a more formal structure , with education , child development , discipline and even preschool education falling into the fold of services ."
22939,"Some childminders care for children from several families at the same time , either in their own home ( commonly known as `` family day care '' in Australia ) or in a specialized child care facility ."
22940,Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment .
22941,"Child care in the child 's own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au pair , or by extended family members including grandparents , aunts and uncles ."
22942,Mars as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope .
22943,"The geology of Mars is the scientific study of the surface , crust , and interior of the planet Mars ."
22944,"It emphasizes the composition , structure , history , and physical processes that shape the planet ."
22945,It is fully analogous to the field of terrestrial geology .
22946,"In planetary science , the term geology is used in its broadest sense to mean the study of the solid parts of planets and moons ."
22947,"The term incorporates aspects of geophysics , geochemistry , mineralogy , geodesy , and cartography ."
22948,"A neologism , areology , from the Greek word Arēs ( Mars ) , sometimes appears as a synonym for Mars ' geology in the popular media and works of science fiction ( e.g. , Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy ) , but the term is rarely , if ever , used by professional geologists and planetary scientists ."
22949,"Harley-Davidson Inc ( , formerly HDI ) , often abbreviated H-D or Harley , is an American motorcycle manufacturer ."
22950,"Founded in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , during the first decade of the 20th century , it was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression ."
22951,Harley-Davidson also survived a period of poor quality control and competition from Japanese manufacturers .
22952,"The company sells today only heavyweight motorcycles with over 750 cc , designed for cruising on highways ."
22953,"Harley-Davidson motorcycles , or `` Harleys '' , are noted for the tradition of heavy customization that gave rise to the chopper style of motorcycle ."
22954,"Except for the modern VRSC model family , current Harley-Davidson motorcycles reflect the styles of classic Harley designs ."
22955,Harley-Davidson 's attempts to establish itself in the light motorcycle market have met little success and have largely been abandoned since the 1978 sale of its Italian Aermacchi subsidiary .
22956,"Harley-Davidson sustains a large brand community which keeps active through clubs , events , and a museum ."

22976,"Shoulder problems including pain , are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms ."
22977,The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body .
22978,"However , it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed ."
22979,"This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury , often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well ."
22980,Shoulder pain may be localized or may be deferred to areas around the shoulder or down the arm .
22981,"Disease within the body ( such as gallbladder , liver , or heart disease , or disease of the cervical spine of the neck ) also may generate pain that the brain may interpret as arising from the shoulder ."
22982,"Conversely , pain felt in the region of the shoulder blade or scapula nearly always has its origin in the neck ."

23027,"Throughout most of the 20th century , although the Republican and Democratic parties alternated in power at a national level , some states were so overwhelmingly dominated by one party that nomination was usually tantamount to election ."
23028,"This was especially true in the Solid South , where the Republican Party was virtually nonexistent for the best part of a century , from the end of Reconstruction in the late 1870s to the 1960s ."
23029,"Conversely , the New England states of Vermont , Maine , and New Hampshire were Republican bastions , as were some Midwestern states like Iowa and North Dakota ."
23030,"However , in the 1970s and 1980s , the increasingly conservative Republican Party gradually overtook the Democrats in the southeast ."
23031,"The Democrats ' support in the formerly Solid South had been eroded during the vast cultural , political and economic upheaval that surrounded the 1960s ."
23032,"By the 1990s the Republican Party had completed the transition into the southeast 's dominant political party , despite typically having fewer members due to the prevalence of Republican voting generational Democrats ."
23033,"In New England , the opposite trend took place ; the former Republican strongholds of Maine and Vermont became solidly Democratic , as did formerly Republican areas of New Jersey , New York , and other states ."
23034,"Currently , the majority of the overall number of seats held in the state legislatures has been switching between the two parties every few years ."
23035,"As of the U.S. gubernatorial elections of 2010 , the Republican party holds an outright majority of approximately 440 with 3,890 seats ( 53 % of total ) compared to the Democratic party 's number of 3,450 ( 47 % of total ) seats elected on a partisan ballot. < ref name= '' www.ncsl.org/ ? tabid=21634 '' > Of the 7,382 seats in all of the state legislatures combined , independents and third parties account for only 15 members , not counting the 49 members of the Nebraska Legislature , which is the only legislature in the nation to hold non-partisan elections to determine its members ."

23040,"Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil- or animal fat-based diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl ( methyl , propyl or ethyl ) esters ."
23041,"Biodiesel is typically made by chemically reacting lipids ( e.g. , vegetable oil , animal fat ( tallow ) ) with an alcohol producing fatty acid esters ."
23042,Biodiesel is meant to be used in standard diesel engines and is thus distinct from the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines .
23043,"Biodiesel can be used alone , or blended with petrodiesel ."
23044,Biodiesel can also be used as a low carbon alternative to heating oil .
23045,The National Biodiesel Board ( USA ) also has a technical definition of `` biodiesel '' as a mono-alkyl ester .

23060,"During the conflict , 649 Argentine military personnel , 255 British military personnel and 3 Falkland Islanders died ."
23061,The conflict was the result of a protracted historical confrontation regarding the sovereignty of the islands .
23062,"Argentina has asserted that the Falkland Islands have been Argentinian territory since the 19th century and , , shows no sign of relinquishing the claim ."
23063,The claim was added to the Argentine constitution after its reformation in 1994 .
23064,"As such , the Argentine government characterised their initial invasion as the re-occupation of their own territory , whilst the British government saw it as an invasion of a British dependent territory ."
23065,"However , neither state officially declared war and hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the local area of the South Atlantic ."
23066,The conflict had a strong impact in both countries .
23067,"Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina , but the outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government , which hastened its downfall ."

23072,"Crocodiles ( subfamily Crocodylinae ) or true crocodiles are large aquatic tetrapods that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia ."
23073,"Crocodylinae , in which all its members are considered true crocodiles , is classified as a biological subfamily ."
23074,"A broader sense of the term crocodile , Crocodylidae , that includes the tomistoma , was excluded in this article since new genetic studies reveal the possibility of tomistoma as a close relative of the gharial ."
23075,This article applies the term crocodile only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae .
23076,"The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia : which includes all members of Crocodylidae , including the tomistoma , the alligators and caimans ( family Alligatoridae ) and the gharials ( family Gavialidae ) , and the rest of Crocodylomorpha , which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors ."
23077,"Although they appear to be similar to the untrained eye , crocodiles , alligators and the gharial belong to seperate biological families ."
23078,"The gharial having a very unique and narrow snout is easier to distinguish , while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators ."
23079,"The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads , with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans ."
23080,"Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width , and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed ; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator ; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into ."
23081,"Also when the crocodile 's mouth is closed , the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw ."
23082,"For hard-to-distinguish specimens , the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family , the species belongs to ."
23083,"Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt , which are present but non-functioning in alligators ."
23084,"Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians , are the much higher levels of aggression ."
23085,"All reptiles , with the exception of Testudines , are all scaled diapsids , but crocodilians are archosaurs , which means they are genetically closer to birds and the extinct dinosaurs , than other reptiles are ."
23086,"Although all crocodiles are anatomically and biologically similar ; their size , morphology , behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species ."
23087,"However , they have many similarities in these areas as well ."
23088,"All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers , lakes , wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater ."
23089,"They are carnivorous animals , feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , birds and mammals , and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans , depending on species and age ."
23090,"All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators , are very sensitive to cold ."
23091,"They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch , about 55 million years ago ."
23092,"A lineage , including the rest of Crocodylomorpha , have been around for at least 225 million years , survived multiple mass extinctions , but today , due to habitat destruction and poaching , many species are at the risk of extinction , some being classified as critically endangered ."

23161,The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the naked candidate to be immersed totally ( submersion ) or partially ( standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her ) .
23162,"While John the Baptist 's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion , pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body ."
23163,Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead .

23211,The box is hooked up to each television set and is accompanied by a remote control unit .
23212,Each family member in a sample household is assigned a personal 'viewing button ' .
23213,It identifies each household member 's age and sex .
23214,"If the TV is turned on and the viewer does n't identify themselves , the meter flashes to remind them ."
23215,"Additional buttons on the People Meter enable guests to participate in the sample by recording their age , sex and viewing status into the system ."
23216,"The device , known as a 'frequency-based meter ' , was invented by a British company called Audits of Great Britain ( AGB ) ."
23217,"The successor company to AGB is TNS , which is active in 34 countries around the globe ."
23218,"Originally , these meters identified the frequency of the channels - VHF or UHF - watched on the viewer 's TV set ."
23219,This system became obsolete when Direct to Home ( DTH ) satellite dish became popular and viewers started to get their own satellite decoders .
23220,"In addition , this system does n't measure digital broadcasts ."
23221,"Before the People Meter advances , Nielsen used the diary method , which consisted of viewers physically recording the shows they watched ."
23222,"However , there were setbacks with the system ."
23223,Lower-rated stations claimed the diary method was inaccurate and biased .
23224,"They argued that because they had lower ratings , those who depended on memory for the diary method the may only remember to track their favorite shows ."
23225,"Stations also argued that if it wasn’t low ratings that skewed the diary method , it might also be the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from ."
23226,Viewers may not be able to record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth .
23227,"Finally in 1986 , Nielsen developed an electronic meter , People Meter , to solve the problem ."
23228,The People Meter is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored .
23229,"The meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing , reducing memory bias ."
23230,"Because Audits of Great Britain ( AGB ) had just entered the U.S. market executing similar technology , Nielsen felt the need to compete ."
23231,Nielson made a substantial technological advance before network-era norms entered crisis with transition to the national People Meter sample in 1987 .
23232,"Although People Meters presented substantial improvements over the previous system , the alteration in audience measurement caused significant controversy ."
23233,The method change costs stations whose audience had been overestimated.The end of the multi-channel transition was in large part due to the continuous changes in technology and distribution .
23234,Nielsen was at a disadvantage as their measuring techniques required burdensome adjustments .
23235,"Luckily for Nielsen , the advances in advertising strategies , distribution windows , and ways people were using television made industry sectors interested in data about viewing behavior ."
23236,"Along with changing their counting methods , Nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 in reaction to census shifts and requests from some industry sectors ."
23237,Nielsen’s automated Local People Meter ( LPM ) technology was introduced in New York and Los Angeles .
23238,The LPM improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored .
23239,The semicolon ( ; ) is a punctuation mark with several uses .
23240,The Italian printer Aldus Manutius the Elder established the practice of using the semicolon to separate words of opposed meaning and to indicate interdependent statements .
23241,`` The first printed semicolon was the work of ... Aldus Manutius `` in 1494 .
23242,Ben Jonson was the first notable English writer to use the semicolon systematically .
23243,The modern uses of the semicolon relate either to the listing of items or to the linking of related clauses .
23244,"According to Lynne Truss , a British writer on grammar , many non-writers avoid the colon and semicolon for various reasons : `` They are old-fashioned '' , `` They are middle-class '' , `` They are optional '' , `` They are mysteriously connected to pausing '' , `` They are dangerously addictive ( vide Virginia Woolf ) '' , and `` The difference between them is too negligible to be grasped by the brain of man '' ."
23245,"However , the semi-colon is used frequently in academic writing ."

23254,"The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations ."
23255,"The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation ."
23256,"England 's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England ."
23257,"However , there are uplands in the north ( for example , the mountainous Lake District , Pennines , and Yorkshire Dales ) and in the south west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Cotswolds ) ."
23258,The former capital of England was Winchester until replaced by London in 1066 .
23259,Today London is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the European Union by most measures .
23260,"England 's population is about 53 million , around 84 % of the population of the United Kingdom , and is largely concentrated in London , the South East and conurbations in the Midlands , the North West , the North East and Yorkshire , which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century ."
23261,Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities .
23262,"The Kingdom of England - which after 1284 included Wales - was a sovereign state until 1 May 1707 , when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year , resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain ."
23263,"In 1801 , Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ."

23265,Blu-ray Disc ( BD ) is an optical disc storage medium designed to supersede the DVD format .
23266,"The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick , the same size as DVDs and CDs ."
23267,"Conventional ( pre-BD-XL ) Blu-ray Discs contain 25 GB per layer , with dual layer discs ( 50 GB ) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs ."
23268,Triple layer discs ( 100 GB ) and quadruple layers ( 150 GB ) are available for BD-XL re-writer drives .
23269,"The name Blu-ray Disc refers to the blue laser used to read the disc , which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs ."
23270,The major application of Blu-ray Discs is as a medium for video material such as feature films .
23271,"Besides the hardware specifications , Blu-ray Disc is associated with a set of multimedia formats ."
23272,"Generally , these formats allow for the video and audio to be stored with greater definition than on DVD ."
23273,"The format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association , a group representing makers of consumer electronics , computer hardware , and motion pictures ."
23274,"The first Blu-ray Disc prototypes were unveiled in October 2000 , and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan ."
23275,"Afterwards , it continued to be developed until its official release in June 2006 ."

23289,"The film won many major awards including the `` Best Film '' honours at the Filmfare Awards , the National Film Awards , Zee Cine Awards , Screen Awards , and Bollywood Movie Awards ."
23290,"Years after its release , it still makes appearances on Indian television and has achieved an iconic status ."
23291,Home-use pressure washer powered by a small gasoline engine
23292,"A pressure washer is a high pressure mechanical sprayer that can be used to remove loose paint , mold , grime , dust , mud , and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings , vehicles , concrete surfaces , etc ."
23293,"The volume of a pressure washer is expressed in either gallons or litres per minute , often designed into the pump and not variable ."
23294,"A pump 's pressure , expressed in pounds per square inch , pascals , or bar ( deprecated but in common usage ) , is also designed into the pump but can be varied by adjusting the unloader valve ."
23295,"Machines that produce pressures from 750 to 30,000 psi ( 5 to 200 MPa ) or more are available ."
23296,The basic pressure washer consists of:
23297,An electric motor or gasoline ( petrol ) engine that directly drives a water pump
23298,A high-pressure hose
23299,Trigger gun -style switch
23300,"Similarly as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of the liquid , a pressure washer adds its own power to create high pressure and velocity ."
23301,The pump can not draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide .
23302,"Moreover , the water supply must be adequate for a given machine connected to it , as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements ."
23303,"Several different types of nozzles are available , each useful for a particular application ."
23304,"Some nozzles cause the water jet to be ejected in a triangular plane ( fan pattern ) , while others emit a thin jet of water , which spirals around rapidly ( cone pattern ) ."
23305,Nozzles that deliver a higher flow rate lower the output pressure .
23306,Most nozzles attach directly to the trigger gun .
23307,"Some pressure washers , in combination with a particular nozzle , allow detergent to be introduced into the water stream , assisting in the cleaning process ."
23308,Two types of chemical injectors are available — a high-pressure injector that introduces the chemical after the water leaves the pump ( a downstream injector ) and a low-pressure injector that introduces the chemical before water enters the pump ( an upstream injector ) .
23309,"The type of injector used is related to the type of detergent used , as there are many chemicals that will damage a pump if an upstream injector is used ."
23310,Pressure washers are dangerous tools and should be operated with due regard to safety instructions .
23311,The water pressure near the nozzle is powerful enough to strip flesh from bone .
23312,Particles in the water supply are ejected from the nozzle at great velocities .
23313,"The cleaning process can propel objects dislodged from the surface being cleaned , also at great velocities ."
23314,"Pressure washers have a tendency to break up tarmac if aimed directly at it , due to high pressure water entering cracks and voids in the surface ."
23315,"Most readily available consumer units , commonly found online or at hardware stores , are electric- or petrol-powered ."
23316,"The electric ones plug into a normal outlet , use cold tap water and typically deliver pressure up to about 2,000 psi ( 140 bar ) ."
23317,"Petrol powered units can often deliver twice that pressure , but due to the hazardous nature of the engine exhaust , they are unsuitable for enclosed or indoor areas ."
23318,"Some models can generate hot water , which can be ideal for loosening and removing oil and grease ."
23319,"`` Black Velvet '' is a blues verse with a rock chorus written by Canadian songwriters Christopher Ward and David Tyson , recorded by Canadian singer songwriter Alannah Myles ."

23321,"It became a number one hit for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1990 and reached number one on the Album Rock Tracks chart , as well as number one in Canada and number two on the UK Singles Chart ."
23322,The song hit No . 1 for two weeks on the Billboard charts in April 1990 .
23323,Myles won the 1990 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocalist for the song .
23324,"Since its release , the song has received substantial airplay , receiving a `` Millionaire Award '' from ASCAP in 2005 for more than four million radio plays ."

23330,"Short term side effects include fatigue , nausea , dizziness , and dehydration , while long term harm includes loss of muscle mass ."
23331,Heritability asks how much genetics are playing a role in differences in height between people .
23332,This is not the same as asking how much genetics influences height in any one person.The
23333,heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences .
23334,"Factors including genetics , environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation between individuals in their observable characteristics ( in their `` phenotypes `` ) ."
23335,Heritability thus analyzes the relative contributions of differences in genetic and non-genetic factors to the total phenotypic variance in a population .
23336,"For instance , some humans in a population are taller than others ; heritability attempts to identify how much genetics are playing a role in part of the population being extra tall ."
23337,Heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population .
23338,"Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics , particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics ( for instance twin studies ) , but is less widely used in population genetics ."
23339,Heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation .
23340,This is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics .
23341,"In addition , heritability can change without any genetic change occurring ( e.g . when the environment starts contributing to more variation ) ."
23342,"A case in point , consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence ."
23343,"Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases , causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show different levels of intelligence ) ."
23344,"On the other hand , heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases , causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation ( e.g . to show more similar levels of intelligence ) ."
23345,"Heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation , or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation ; what matters is the relative contribution ."
23346,Here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment .
23347,The extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved .
23348,"Matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype , making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments ."
23349,"Individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity , which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases ."
23350,Recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes .
23351,"However , there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment ."

23357,Christianity in Africa began in Egypt in the middle of the 1st century .
23358,By the end of the 2nd century it had reached the region around Carthage .
23359,"Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity include Tertullian , Clement of Alexandria , Origen of Alexandria , Cyprian , Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo ."
23360,"The spread of Islam into North Africa reduced the size of Christian congregations as well as their number , so that of the original Churches , only the Coptic Church in Egypt , the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church in the Horn of Africa remain ."
23361,"Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches profess their own distinctive customs , a unique canon of the Bible and a distinctive architectures ."
23362,"Both these community of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa which is not the product of European missionary work , but can document its foundation prior to any European countries ."
23363,Christianity is embraced by the majority of the population in most Southern African and Central African states and others in some East and West Africa .
23364,The Coptic Christians make up a significant minority in Egypt .
23365,"The World Book Encyclopedia has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40 % of the continent 's population , with Muslims forming 45 % ."
23366,"In a relatively short time , Africa has gone from having a majority of followers of indigenous , traditional religions , to being predominantly a continent of Christians and Muslims ."
23367,"Today in 2013 , Traditional African religions is the majority religion only in Togo ."
23368,"In South Sudan , no official statistics currently exist and some scholarly studies state that native African religion is more popular than Christianity ."
23369,"However , the most recent December 18 , 2012 Pew Forum research estimates that in 2010 , 6.010 million Christians , 3.270 million traditional African religion followers , 610,000 Muslims and 50,000 unaffiliated ( no known religion ) peoples lived in South Sudan ."
23370,"This would mean that in 2010 according to Pew Forum , about 60.46 % of the population of South Sudan 's 9,940,000 population were Christian while 32.9 % were followers of traditional African religions ."
23371,Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ( D.O . or DO ) is a professional doctoral degree for physicians offered by medical schools in the United States .
23372,"Holders of the D.O . degree are known as osteopathic physicians and have the same rights , privileges , and responsibilities as physicians with a Doctor of Medicine degree ( M.D . ) ."
23373,"D.O . physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in all 50 states , and make up 7 percent of the total U.S. physician population ."
23374,"There are over 77,784 D.O . physicians in the United States , of which 69,429 are in active practice ."
23375,"Currently , there are 29 medical schools with 37 locations throughout the United States that offer the D.O . degree , and 141 medical schools that offer the M.D . degree ."
23376,"As of 2011 , 1 in 5 medical students in the United States were D.O . students ."
23377,The curricula at osteopathic medical schools are very similar to those at M.D.-granting medical schools .
23378,"Four years in total length , the first two years of medical school focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences , followed by two years of core clinical training in the clinical specialties ."
23379,One notable difference in the education at D.O.-granting medical schools is the inclusion of 300 – 500 additional hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body 's musculoskeletal system .
23380,"This training , referred to as osteopathic manipulative medicine , is absent in the M.D . curricula ."
23381,"Upon graduation from medical school , osteopathic physicians enter internship or residency training programs , which may be followed by fellowship training ."
23382,"Many D.O . physicians attend the same graduate medical education programs as their M.D . counterparts , and then take M.D . specialty board exams , while other D.O . graduates enter osteopathic programs and take D.O . specialty board examinations ."
23383,"However , as of June 2015 , all post-graduate training for both D.O . and M.D . physicians will be accredited by the ACGME ."

23394,"Operation Torch ( initially called Operation Gymnast ) was the British – American invasion of French North Africa in World War II during the North African Campaign , started on 8 November 1942 ."
23395,The Soviet Union had pressed the U.S. and Britain to start operations in Europe and open a second front to reduce the pressure of German forces on the Soviet troops .
23396,"While the American commanders favored Operation Sledgehammer , landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible , the British commanders believed that such a course would end in disaster ."
23397,"An attack on French North Africa was proposed instead , which would clear the Axis Powers from North Africa , improve naval control of the Mediterranean Sea and prepare for an invasion of Southern Europe in 1943 ."
23398,American President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspected the African operation would rule out an invasion of Europe in 1943 but agreed to support British Prime Minister Winston Churchill .

23400,"In computing , data deduplication is a specialized data compression technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data ."
23401,Related and somewhat synonymous terms are intelligent ( data ) compression and single-instance ( data ) storage .
23402,The technique is used to improve storage utilization and can also be applied to network data transfers to reduce the number of bytes that must be sent .
23403,"In the deduplication process , unique chunks of data , or byte patterns , are identified and stored during a process of analysis ."
23404,"As the analysis continues , other chunks are compared to the stored copy and whenever a match occurs , the redundant chunk is replaced with a small reference that points to the stored chunk ."
23405,"Given that the same byte pattern may occur dozens , hundreds , or even thousands of times ( the match frequency is dependent on the chunk size ) , the amount of data that must be stored or transferred can be greatly reduced ."
23406,"This type of deduplication is different from that performed by standard file-compression tools , such as LZ77 and LZ78 ."
23407,"Whereas these tools identify short repeated substrings inside individual files , the intent of storage-based data deduplication is to inspect large volumes of data and identify large sections – such as entire files or large sections of files – that are identical , in order to store only one copy of it ."
23408,This copy may be additionally compressed by single-file compression techniques .
23409,For example a typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same one megabyte ( MB ) file attachment .
23410,"Each time the email platform is backed up , all 100 instances of the attachment are saved , requiring 100 MB storage space ."
23411,"With data deduplication , only one instance of the attachment is actually stored ; the subsequent instances are referenced back to the saved copy for deduplication ratio of roughly 100 to 1 ."

23415,The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is the flag used by Elizabeth II in her capacity as Sovereign of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories .
23416,"Different standards are used in the Queen 's other Commonwealth realms , and the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is varied for use in Scotland ."
23417,"Although almost universally called a standard , such flags when used in the United Kingdom are banners of arms , as they comprise the shield of the Royal Arms ."
23418,"Outside the United Kingdom , the Royal Standard is usually a nation 's banner of arms with a blue disc containing a wreath of gold roses encircling the crowned letter 'E ' , ( for 'Elizabeth ' ) , superimposed upon it ( the Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II ) ."
23419,The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal residences .

23422,"The only church that may fly a Royal Standard , even without the presence of the Sovereign , is Westminster Abbey , which is a Royal Peculiar ."
23423,Other churches generally are not allowed to hoist a Royal Standard .
23424,The Royal Standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present .
23425,"If the Union Flag is flying above Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle instead of the Royal Standard , the Queen is not in residence ."
23426,"If the ancient Royal Standard of Scotland is flying above Holyrood Palace or Balmoral Castle , instead of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland , it also indicates that the Queen is not in residence ."
23427,"When the Queen attends the Parliament at the Palace of Westminster , the Royal Standard flies from Victoria Tower ."
23428,"Unlike the Union Flag , the usual rule is that the Royal Standard is never flown at half-staff , even after the demise of the Crown , as there is always a sovereign on the throne ."
23429,"Strictly speaking , however , the Royal Standard may be flown at half-staff above a building or on board a boat in which the unburied body of a deceased monarch is lying ( as long as the present monarch is not in attendance ) ."
23430,"When controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half-staff over Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales in 1997 , a compromise was reached whereby the Union Flag was flown at half-staff ."
23431,"( The Queen was then in summer residence in Balmoral ; previously , no flag had flown over Buckingham Palace when the monarch was not present ."
23432,"Since then , the Union Flag has been flown in the Queen 's absence . )"
23433,"However the Union Flag can be lowered to fly at half-staff over Buckingham Palace , in times of national mourning ( for example after the death of the Queen Mother , the September 11 attacks and the 7 July 2005 London bombings ."

23450,Non-binding price ceiling
23451,"Pricing , quantity , and welfare effects of a binding price ceiling"
23452,A price ceiling is a government-imposed limit on how high a price is charged for a product .
23453,Governments intend price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make necessary commodities unattainable .
23454,"However , a price ceiling can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing ."
23455,Price ceilings can produce negative results when the correct solution would have been to increase supply .
23456,Misuse occurs when a government misdiagnoses a price as too high when the real problem is that the supply is too low .
23457,In an unregulated market economy price ceilings do not exist .
23458,"Students may incorrectly perceive a price ceiling as being on top of a supply and demand curve when in fact , an effective price ceiling is positioned below the equilibrium position on the graph ."
23459,Stem showing internode and nodes plus leaf petioles
23460,A stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant .
23461,"The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes , the nodes hold buds which grow into one or more leaves , inflorescence ( flowers ) , conifer cones , roots , other stems etc ."
23462,The internodes distance one node from another .
23463,The term shoots is often confused with stems ; shoots generally refer to new fresh plant growth and does include stems but also to other structures like leaves or flowers .
23464,The other main structural axis of plants is the root .
23465,In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems .
23466,A stem develops buds and shoots and usually grows above the ground .
23467,"Inside the stem , materials move up and down the tissues of the transport system ."
23468,Stems have four main functions which are:
23469,"Support for and the elevation of leaves , flowers and fruits ."

23717,`` Barrow '' is a derivation of the Old English `` bearwe '' which was a device used for carrying loads .
23718,The wheelbarrow is designed to distribute the weight of its load between the wheel and the operator so enabling the convenient carriage of heavier and bulkier loads than would be possible were the weight carried entirely by the operator .

23734,"Conventionally , the name of the root note denotes the chord ."
23735,"Thus , a major chord built upon C is called a C major chord ."

24174,"Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones , and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant ( non-dominant follicles atrophy and die ) ."
24175,"Approximately mid-cycle , 24–36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) surges , the dominant follicle releases an ovum , or egg in an event called ovulation ."
24176,"After ovulation , the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum ; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone ."
24177,"Under the influence of progesterone , the endometrium ( uterine lining ) changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy ."

24219,"Additionally , music for Star Wars : The Clone Wars was written by Kevin Kiner , and further music has been composed for Star Wars video games and works in other media ."
24220,"The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles , many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner ."
24221,"While several obvious nods to Gustav Holst , William Walton and Igor Stravinsky exist in the score to Episode IV , Williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores , incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score ."

24328,"Also in these languages the respective terms do not necessarily refer to a church functioning as a cathedral , but also to proto-cathedrals or simply prominent church buildings , which have never been a cathedral in the exact sense of that word ."
24329,"In German the term Dom became the synecdoche , used - pars pro toto - for most existing or former collegiate churches ."

24339,The background to the Crusades was the centuries of Arab–Byzantine Wars and the Seljuq-Byzantine Wars and the recent decisive defeat of the Byzantine army by Seljuk Turks at Manzikert in 1071 .

24346,Several hundred thousand soldiers became Crusaders by taking vows ; the Pope granted them plenary indulgence .
24347,Their emblem was the cross — the term `` crusade '' is derived from the French term for taking up the cross .
24348,"Many were from France and called themselves `` Franks , '' which became the common term used by Muslims ."
24349,"Europeans had historically called the occupants of the Holy Land Saracens , and used this in a negative sense throughout the Crusades and often into European history books into the 20th century ."
24350,"The term `` crusade '' is also used to describe religiously motivated campaigns conducted between 1100 and 1600 in territories outside the Levant usually against pagans , heretics , and peoples under the ban of excommunication for a mixture of religious , economic , and political reasons ."
24351,"Rivalries among both Christian and Muslim powers led also to alliances between religious factions against their opponents , such as the Christian alliance with the Islamic Sultanate of Rûm during the Fifth Crusade ."

24371,"In astronomy , the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer 's perspective ."
24372,"Considered a very important effect in astronomy , it is different from seasonal constellations ."
24373,Circumpolar constellations stay in the sky .
24374,"Because of the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun , we divide the stars and constellations into two groups ."
24375,"Some stars and constellations never rise nor set , and they are called circumpolar ."
24376,All the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations .
24377,Which stars and constellations will be circumpolar and which seasonal depends on your latitude .
24378,"In the northern hemisphere , we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the northern circumpolar sky , while in the southern hemisphere , we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the southern circumpolar sky ."

24405,"In addition , California , which briefly granted same-sex marriages in 2008 , now recognizes them on a conditional basis ."
24406,"While several jurisdictions have legalized same-sex marriage through court rulings , legislative action , and popular vote , nine states prohibit same-sex marriage by statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions ."
24407,"The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , enacted in 1996 , prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and allows each state to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states ."

24420,"A Roth IRA ( Individual Retirement Arrangement ) is a special type of retirement plan under US law that is generally not taxed , provided certain conditions are met ."
24421,The tax law of the United States allows a tax reduction on a limited amount of saving for retirement .
24422,"The Roth IRA 's principal difference from most other tax advantaged retirement plans is that , rather than granting a tax break for money placed into the plan , the tax break is granted on the money withdrawn from the plan during retirement ."
24423,"A Roth IRA can be an individual retirement account containing investments in securities , usually common stocks and bonds , often through mutual funds ( although other investments , including derivatives , notes , certificates of deposit , and real estate are possible ) ."
24424,"A Roth IRA can also be an individual retirement annuity , which is an annuity contract or an endowment contract purchased from a life insurance company ."
24425,"As with all IRAs , the Internal Revenue Service mandates specific eligibility and filing status requirements ."
24426,A Roth IRA 's main advantages are its tax structure and the additional flexibility that this tax structure provides .
24427,"Also , there are fewer restrictions on the investments that can be made in the plan than many other tax advantaged plans , and this adds somewhat to the popularity , though the investment options available depend on the trustee ( or the place where the plan is established ) ."
24428,The total contributions allowed per year to all IRAs is the lesser of one 's taxable compensation ( which is not the same as adjusted gross income ) and the limit amounts as seen below ( this total may be split up between any number of traditional and Roth IRAs .
24429,"In the case of a married couple , each spouse may contribute the amount listed ) :"
24430,"For example , if one is single , aged 49 or under , and earns $ 10,000 , one can contribute a maximum of $ 5,000 in 2008 ."
24431,"However , if one is single and earns $ 2,000 , one can contribute only a maximum of $ 2,000 in 2008 ( $ 2,000 is the lesser of $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 ) ."
24432,"* Since 2009 , contribution limits have been assessed for potential increases based on inflation , though the contribution limits for 2009 through 2012 remained unchanged ."

24454,This is accomplished either by acting presynaptically via the inhibition of acetylcholine ( ACh ) synthesis or release or by acting postsynaptically at the acetylcholine receptors of the motor nerve end-plate .
24455,"While some drugs act presynaptically ( such as botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin ) , those of current clinical importance work postsynaptically ."
24456,"In clinical use , neuromuscular block is used adjunctively to anesthesia to produce paralysis , firstly to paralyse the vocal cords , and permit intubation of the trachea , and secondly to optimize the surgical field by inhibiting spontaneous ventilation , and causing relaxation of skeletal muscles ."
24457,"Because the appropriate dose of neuromuscular-blocking drug may paralyze muscles required for breathing ( i.e. , the diaphragm ) , mechanical ventilation should be available to maintain adequate respiration ."
24458,"Patients are still aware of pain even after full conduction block has occurred ; hence , general anesthetics and/or analgesics must also be given to prevent anesthesia awareness ."
24459,"Quaternary ammonium muscle relaxants are quaternary ammonium salts used as drugs for muscle relaxation , most commonly in anesthesia ."
24460,It is necessary to prevent spontaneous movement of muscle during surgical operations .
24461,Muscle relaxants inhibit neuron transmission to muscle by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor .
24462,"What they have in common , and is necessary for their effect , is the structural presence of quaternary ammonium groups , usually two ."

24656,"The codomain is a set containing the function 's output , whereas the image is only the part of the codomain where the elements are outputs of the function ."
24657,"For example , the function is often described as a function from the real numbers to the real numbers , meaning that the codomain is R , but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers ."
24658,"Some books say that range of this function is its codomain , the set of all real numbers , reflecting that the function is real-valued ."
24659,These books call the actual output of the function the image .

24813,Smoked Vienna sausages
24814,North American Vienna sausage in tomato sauce
24815,"A vienna sausage ( , Viennese / Austrian German : Frankfurter Würstel or Würstl , Swiss German Wienerli , Swabian : Wienerle or Saitenwurst , French : Saucisse de strasbourg or Saucisse de francfort , Swiss Romand : Saucisse de vienne , Hungarian : virsli , Italian : Würstel , Polish parówka , Romanian crenvurșt , and Russian sosiska ) is a kind of sausage ."
24816,The word Wiener means Viennese in German .
24817,"The sausage was invented by a butcher from Frankfurt , who had moved to Vienna , which is why in Vienna the sausage is called Frankfurter ."
24818,"In some European countries , cooked and often smoked wieners bought fresh from supermarkets , delicatessens and butcher shops may be called by a name ( such as in German or French ) which translates in English as `` Vienna sausage '' ."
24819,"Wieners sold as vienna sausage in Europe have a taste and texture very much like North American `` hot dogs `` or `` frankfurters '' , but are usually longer and somewhat thinner , with a very light , edible casing ."
24820,"European vienna sausage served hot in a long bun with condiments is often called a `` hot dog '' , harking not to the wiener itself , but to the long sandwich as a whole ."
24821,"In North America , the term `` vienna sausage '' has most often come to mean only smaller and much shorter smoked and canned wieners , rather than hot dogs ."
24822,"North American vienna sausages are mainly made from pork , but also meat such as beef , turkey and chicken , ( or blends thereof ) finely ground to a paste consistency and mixed with salt and spices , notably mustard , then stuffed into a long casing , sometimes smoked and always thoroughly cooked , after which the casings are removed as with hot dogs ."
24823,The sausages are then cut into short segments for canning and further cooking .
24824,They are also available packed in chili or barbecue sauces .
24825,"As with any sausage , the ingredients , preparation , size and taste can vary widely by both manufacturer and region of sale ."

24831,Raw T-bone steak showing moderate marbling and the smaller tenderloin ( or fillet ) and larger strip steak portions
24832,The T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin .
24833,Both steaks include a `` T-shaped `` bone with meat on each side .
24834,"Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak , along with ( on the other side of the bone ) a large strip steak ."
24835,"T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front , and contain a smaller section of tenderloin ."
24836,There is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse .
24837,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least thick at its widest , while that of a T-bone must be at least ."
24838,However steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a `` T-bone '' in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse .
24839,"Due to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef ( the short loin and the tenderloin ) , T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks , and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high ."
24840,Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued due to their larger tenderloin .
24841,"In the United States , the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174 ; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173 ."
24842,"In British usage , followed in Commonwealth countries , porterhouse refers to the strip steak side of a T-bone steak , while the tenderloin side is called the fillet ."

24845,"A function f takes an input x , and returns an output f ( x ) ."
24846,One metaphor describes the function as a `` machine '' or `` black box `` that for each input returns a corresponding output .
24847,"The red curve is the graph of a function f in the Cartesian plane , consisting of all points with coordinates of the form ( x , f ( x ) ) ."
24848,The property of having one output for each input is represented geometrically by the fact that each vertical line ( such as the yellow line through the origin ) has exactly one crossing point with the curve .
24849,"In mathematics , a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output ."
24850,An example is the function that relates each real number x to its square x2 .
24851,The output of a function f corresponding to an input x is denoted by f ( x ) ( read `` f of x '' ) .
24852,"In this example , if the input is −3 , then the output is 9 , and we may write f ( −3 ) = 9 ."
24853,The input variable ( s ) are sometimes referred to as the argument ( s ) of the function .
24854,Functions are `` the central objects of investigation '' in most fields of modern mathematics .
24855,There are many ways to describe or represent a function .
24856,Some functions may be defined by a formula or algorithm that tells how to compute the output for a given input .
24857,"Others are given by a picture , called the graph of the function ."
24858,"In science , functions are sometimes defined by a table that gives the outputs for selected inputs ."
24859,"A function can be described through its relationship with other functions , for example as an inverse function or as a solution of a differential equation ."
24860,"The input and output of a function can be expressed as an ordered pair , ordered so that the first element is the input ( or tuple of inputs , if the function takes more than one input ) , and the second is the output ."
24861,"In the example above , f ( x ) = x2 , we have the ordered pair ( −3 , 9 ) ."
24862,"If both input and output are real numbers , this ordered pair can be viewed as the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the graph of the function ."
24863,But no picture can exactly define every point in an infinite set .
24864,"In modern mathematics , a function is defined by its set of inputs , called the domain , a set containing the outputs , called its codomain , and the set of all paired input and outputs , called the graph ."
24865,"For example , we could define a function using the rule f ( x ) = x2 by saying that the domain and codomain are the real numbers , and that the ordered pairs are all pairs of real numbers ( x , x2 ) ."
24866,"Collections of functions with the same domain and the same codomain are called function spaces , the properties of which are studied in such mathematical disciplines as real analysis and complex analysis ."
24867,"In analogy with arithmetic , it is possible to define addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division of functions , in those cases where the output is a number ."
24868,"Another important operation defined on functions is function composition , where the output from one function becomes the input to another function ."
24869,"The Mississippi River Alluvial Plain is an alluvial plain created by the Mississippi River on which lies parts of seven U.S. states , from southern Louisiana to southern Illinois ."
24870,The plain is divided into the Mississippi River Delta in the southern half of Louisiana and the inland Mississippi embayment running from central Louisiana to Illinois .
24871,"The term Mississippi embayment is sometimes used more narrowly to refer to the section on the western side of the river , running through eastern Arkansas , southeastern Missouri , westernmost Tennessee , westernmost Kentucky and southern Illinois , and excluding northwest Mississippi ( the alluvial plain known as the Mississippi Delta ) on the east bank ."
24872,"It is the largest ecoregion of Louisiana , covering , and including all of the historic Mississippi River floodplain ."
24873,"The Space Shuttle was a crewed , partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) ."
24874,"Its official program name was Space Transportation System , taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development ."
24875,"The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 , leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 ."
24876,"It was used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 , launched from the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) in Florida ."
24877,"Operational missions launched numerous satellites , interplanetary probes , and the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ; conducted science experiments in orbit ; and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station ."
24878,"Shuttle components included the Orbiter Vehicle ( OV ) , a pair of recoverable Solid Rocket Boosters ( SRB ) , and an expendable External Tank ( ET ) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen ."
24879,"The Shuttle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV 's three main engines , which were fueled from the External Tank ."
24880,"The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit , and the ET was jettisoned just before orbit insertion using the orbiter 's two Orbital Maneuvering System ( OMS ) engines ."
24881,"At the conclusion of the mission , the orbiter fired its OMS to drop out of orbit and re-enter the atmosphere ."
24882,"The orbiter glided to a runway landing on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards Air Force Base in California , or at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the KSC ."
24883,"After Edwards landings , the orbiter was flown back to KSC on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft , a specially built Boeing 747 ."
24884,"The first orbiter , Enterprise , was built purely for Approach and Landing Tests and had no capability to fly into orbit ."
24885,"Four fully operational orbiters were initially built : Columbia , Challenger , Discovery , and Atlantis ."
24886,"Of these , Challenger and Columbia were lost in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively , in which a total of fourteen astronauts were killed ."
24887,"A fifth operational orbiter , Endeavour , was built in 1991 to replace Challenger ."
24888,"The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of Atlantiss final flight on July 21 , 2011 ."
24889,Pressure as exerted by particle collisions inside a closed container .
24890,Pressure ( the symbol : p ) is the ratio of force to the area over which that force is distributed .
24891,Pressure is force per unit area applied in a direction perpendicular to the surface of an object .
24892,Gauge pressure ( also spelled gage pressure ) is the pressure relative to the local atmospheric or ambient pressure .
24893,"While pressure may be measured in any unit of force divided by any unit of area , the SI unit of pressure ( the newton per square metre ) is called the pascal ( Pa ) after the seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal ."
24894,A pressure of 1 Pa is small ; it approximately equals the pressure exerted by a dollar bill resting flat on a table .
24895,Everyday pressures are often stated in kilopascals ( 1 kPa = 1000 Pa ) .

25008,The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball .
25009,"In addition to the lacrosse stick , players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment ."
25010,Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact .
25011,The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal .
25012,"Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 31-member Federation of International Lacrosse , which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years ."
25013,"A former Olympic sport , attempts by the international governing body to reinstate it to the Games has been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men 's and women 's versions of the sport until 2008 ."

25029,This part of the theorem is also important because it guarantees the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions .
25030,"The second part , sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus , allows one to compute the definite integral of a function by using any one of its infinitely many antiderivatives ."
25031,"This part of the theorem has invaluable practical applications , because it markedly simplifies the computation of definite integrals ."
25032,The first published statement and proof of a restricted version of the fundamental theorem was by James Gregory ( 1638–1675 ) .
25033,Isaac Barrow ( 1630–1677 ) proved a more generalized version of the theorem while Barrow 's student Isaac Newton ( 1643–1727 ) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory .
25034,Gottfried Leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today .

25231,"The United States Oath of Allegiance ( officially referred to as the `` Oath of Allegiance , '' 8 C.F.R . Part 337 ( 2008 ) ) is an oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens ."
25232,"The first officially recorded Oaths of Allegiance were made on May 30 , 1778 at Valley Forge , during the Revolutionary War ."
25233,"Soldiers , Sailors , and Marines state the Oath of Allegiance at a Citizenship ceremony at Camp Liberty , Iraq in 2009"
25234,The current oath is as follows:
25235,"In some cases , the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services ( CIS ) allows the oath to be taken without the clauses regarding the bearing of arms and performance of noncombatant military service ."
25236,provides that the phrase `` so help me God '' is optional and that the words ‘on oath’ can be substituted with ‘and solemnly affirm’ .
25237,"Also , if the prospective citizen can prove such commitments are in violation with his or her religion , the lines `` that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by law ; that I will perform non-combatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by law '' are sometimes omitted ."
25238,The current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch .
25239,"However , under the Administrative Procedure Act , CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time , so long as the new text reasonably meets the `` five principles '' mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953 ."
25240,These principles are:
25241,"allegiance to the United States Constitution ,"
25242,renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances
25243,defense of the Constitution against enemies `` foreign and domestic ''
25244,promise to serve in the United States Armed Forces when required by law ( either combat or non-combat )
25245,promise to perform civilian duties of `` national importance '' when required by law
25246,"There has been some controversy about the wording of the oath , parts of which are based on the British Oath of Supremacy which was written in the 16th Century ."
25247,"As a result , some have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing ."
25248,"In the fall of 2003 , CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for Citizenship Day ( September 17 ) ."
25249,The proposed oath was as followed:
25250,"The introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration , Border Security , and Claims on April 1 , 2004 ."

25253,"Since the mid-1990s , several competitors ( e.g. , Siemens AG ( later Infineon Technologies AG , now Intel mobile communications ) , NEC , Texas Instruments , STMicroelectronics ( formerly SGS-Thomson ) , Motorola ( later Freescale ) , Intersil , etc . ) brought I2C products on the market , which are fully compatible with the NXP ( formerly Philips ' semiconductor division ) I2C-system ."
25254,"Since October 10 , 2006 , no licensing fees are required to implement the I2C protocol ."
25255,"However , fees are still required to obtain I2C slave addresses allocated by NXP ."
25256,"SMBus , defined by Intel in 1995 , is a subset of I2C that defines the protocols more strictly ."
25257,One purpose of SMBus is to promote robustness and interoperability .
25258,"Accordingly , modern I2C systems incorporate policies and rules from SMBus , sometimes supporting both I2C and SMBus with minimal reconfiguration required ."
25259,"The Tour de France ( ) is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France , while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries ."
25260,The race was first organized in 1903 to increase paper sales for the magazine L'Auto ; it is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation .
25261,The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except for when it was stopped for the two World Wars .
25262,As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe .
25263,"Participation expanded from a primarily French field , as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year ."
25264,"The Tour is a UCI World Tour event , which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams , with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite ."
25265,"Along with the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España , the Tour makes up cycling 's prestigious , three-week-long Grand Tours ."
25266,"Traditionally , the race is usually held primarily in the month of July ."
25267,"While the route changes each year , the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of at least two time trials , the passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps , and the finish on the Champs-Élysées ."
25268,The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long segments ( stages ) over a 23-day period .
25269,All of the stages are timed to the finish ; after finishing the riders ' times are compounded with their previous stage times .
25270,The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the coveted yellow jersey .
25271,"While the general classification garners the most attention there are other contests held within the Tour : the points classification for the sprinters , the mountains classification for the climbers with general classification hopes , young rider classification for the riders under the age of 26 , and the team classification for the fastest teams ."

25275,"These inflated perceptions have been found in many educational institutions , with varying populations and locations ."
25276,"Despite the fact that college drinking is at elevated levels , the perceived amount almost always exceeds actual behavior The social norms approach has shown signs of countering misperceptions , however research on resulting changes in behavior resulting from changed perceptions varies between mixed to conclusively nonexistent ."
25277,"Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data – regardless of content , type , or structure – into suitably sized blocks , called packets ."
25278,"First proposed for military uses in the early 1960s and implemented on small networks in 1968 , this method of data transmission became one of the fundamental networking technologies behind the Internet and most local area networks ."
25279,Packet switching features delivery of variable-bit-rate data streams ( sequences of packets ) over a shared network .
25280,"When traversing network adapters , switches , routers and other network nodes , packets are buffered and queued , resulting in variable delay and throughput depending on the traffic load in the network ."
25281,"Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , a method which sets up a limited number of dedicated connections of constant bit rate and constant delay between nodes for exclusive use during the communication session ."
25282,"In case of traffic fees ( as opposed to flat rate ) , for example in cellular communication services , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per time unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred , while packet switching is characterized by a fee per unit of information ."
25283,Packet mode communication may be utilized with or without intermediate forwarding nodes ( packet switches or routers ) .
25284,"In all packet mode communication , network resources are managed by statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation in which a communication channel is effectively divided into an arbitrary number of logical variable-bit-rate channels or data streams ."
25285,"Statistical multiplexing , packet switching and other store-and-forward buffering introduces varying latency and throughput in the transmission ."
25286,"Each logical stream consists of a sequence of packets , which normally are forwarded by the multiplexers and intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering ."
25287,"Alternatively , the packets may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket ."
25288,"In case of a shared physical medium , the packets may be delivered according to some packet-mode multiple access scheme ."

25299,"In 1845 , the United States of America annexed the Republic of Texas and admitted it to the Union as the 28th state ."
25300,"The U.S. thus inherited Texas ' border dispute with Mexico ; this quickly led to the Mexican-American War , during which the U.S. captured additional territory ( known as the Mexican Cession of 1848 ) , extending the nation 's borders all the way to the Pacific Ocean ."
25301,"Texas claimed the eastern part of this new territory , comprising parts of present-day Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico , Texas , Wyoming , Utah , and Oklahoma ."
25302,"The resulting dispute among Texas , the federal government , and New Mexico Territory was resolved in the Compromise of 1850 , when much of these lands became parts of other territories of the United States in exchange for the U.S. federal government assuming the Texas Republic 's $ 10 million in debt ."

25309,The Articles of Confederation : predecessor to the U.S. Constitution and drafted from Anti-Federalist principles
25310,Anti-Federalism refers to a movement that opposed the creation of a stronger U.S. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the Constitution of 1787 .
25311,"The previous constitution , called the Articles of Confederation , gave state governments more authority ."
25312,"Led by Patrick Henry of Virginia , Anti-Federalists worried , among other things , that the position of president , then a novelty , might evolve into a monarchy ."
25313,A book titled `` The Anti-Federalist Papers `` is a detailed explanation of American Anti-Federalist thought .
25314,During the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath the term `` federal '' was applied to any person who supported the colonial union and the government formed under the Articles of Confederation .
25315,After the war the group who felt that the national government under the Articles was too weak appropriated the name Federalist for themselves .
25316,"Historian Jackson Turner Main wrote that , `` to them , the man of 'federal principles ' approved of 'federal measures , ' which meant those that increased the weight and authority or extended the influence of the Confederation Congress . ''"
25317,"As the Federalists moved to amend the Articles , eventually leading to the Constitutional Convention , they applied the term anti-federalist to their opposition ."
25318,"The term implied , correctly or not , both opposition to Congress and unpatriotic motives ."
25319,"The Anti-Federalists rejected the term , arguing that they were the true Federalists ."
25320,In both their correspondence and their local groups they tried to capture the term .
25321,"For example , an unknown anti-federalist signed his public correspondence as `` A Federal Farmer '' and the New York committee opposing the Constitution was called the `` Federal Republican Committee . ''"
25322,However the Federalists carried the day and the name Anti-Federalist forever stuck .
25323,"The Anti-Federalists were composed of diverse elements , including those opposed to the Constitution because they thought that a stronger government threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states , localities , or individuals ; those that claimed a new centralized , disguised `` monarchic '' power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great Britain with the proposed government ; and those who simply feared that the new government threatened their personal liberties ."
25324,Some of the opposition believed that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was sufficient .
25325,"Still others believed that while the national government under the Articles was too weak , the national government under the Constitution would be too strong ."
25326,Another complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitution provided for a centralized rather than Federal Government ( and in the Federalist papers James Madison admits that the new Constitution has the characteristics of both a centralized and federal form of the government ) and that a truly federal form of government was a leaguing of states as under the Articles of Confederation .
25327,"During the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution , numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country ."
25328,"Initially , many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms , such as `` Brutus , '' `` Centinel , '' and `` Federal Farmer . ''"
25329,"Eventually , famous revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry came out publicly against the Constitution ."
25330,They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the President would become a king .
25331,They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution .
25332,This produced a phenomenal body of political writing ; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the Anti-Federalist Papers in allusion to the Federalist Papers .
25333,"In every state the opposition to the Constitution was strong , and in two states — North Carolina and Rhode Island — it prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the new government practically forced their adherence ."
25334,"Individualism was the strongest element of opposition ; the necessity , or at least the desirability , of a bill of rights was almost universally felt ."
25335,"In Rhode Island resistance against the Constitution was so strong that civil war almost broke out on July 4 , 1788 , when anti-federalist members of the Country Party led by Judge William West marched into Providence with over 1,000 armed protesters ."
25336,The Anti-Federalists played upon these feelings in the ratification convention in Massachusetts .
25337,"By this point , five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease , but the Massachusetts convention was far more bitter and contentious ."
25338,"Finally , after long debate , a compromise ( known as the `` Massachusetts compromise `` ) was reached ."

25346,"Red Bull is an energy drink sold by Austrian company Red Bull GmbH , created in 1987 ."
25347,"In terms of market share , Red Bull is the most popular energy drink in the world , with 4.6 billion cans sold in 2011 ."
25348,"Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by a pre-existing energy drink named Krating Daeng ( , ) , which was first invented and sold in Thailand ."
25349,"He took this idea , modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of westerners , and , in partnership with Chaleo Yoovidhya , founded Red Bull GmbH in Austria ."
25350,"In Thai , daeng means red , and krating is the reddish-brown bovine called a `` gaur `` , which is an animal slightly larger than the bison ."
25351,Red Bull is sold in a tall and slim blue-silver can ; in Thailand and in some parts of Asia it is sold in a wider gold can with the name of Krating Daeng or Red Bull Classic .
25352,"The two are different products , produced separately ."
25353,"The company slogan is `` Red Bull gives you wings '' and the product is marketed through advertising , events ( Red Bull Air Race , Red Bull Crashed Ice ) , sports team ownerships ( Red Bull Racing , Scuderia Toro Rosso , EC Red Red_Bull_Salzburg Bull Red_Bull_Salzburg Salzburg Red_Bull_Salzburg , FC Red Red_Bull_Salzburg Bull Red_Bull_Salzburg Salzburg Red_Bull_Salzburg , Red Bull New York , RB Leipzig Leipzig , Red Bull Brasil ) , celebrity endorsements , and music , through its record label Red Bull Records ."
25354,Red Bull has been the target of criticism concerning the possible health risks associated with the drink .
25355,"A study by the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) concluded that in the levels used in popular energy drinks , like Red Bull , taurine and glucuronolactone are safe ."
25356,"Tariffs in United States history have played important roles in trade policy , political debates and the nation 's economic history ."
25357,"The 1st United States Congress , wanting a straightforward tax that was not too onerous and easy to collect , passed the Tariff of 1790 ."
25358,Like all subsequent tariffs it taxed imported goods at their Ports of entry to raise revenue for the federal government .
25359,"Treasury agents collected the tariff before goods could be landed , and what became the Coast Guard prevented smuggling ."
25360,Tariffs were the largest ( approaching 95 % at times ) source of federal revenue until the Federal income tax began after 1913 .
25361,For well over a century the federal government was largely financed by tariffs averaging about 20 % on foreign imports .
25362,There are no tariffs for imports or shipments from other states .
25363,Since the 1940s foreign trade policies have focused more on reciprocal tariffs and low tariff rates rather than using tariffs as a significant source of Federal tax revenue .
25364,"The goal of using higher tariffs to promote industrialization was urged by the first Secretary of the Treasury , Alexander Hamilton , and after him the Whig Party ."
25365,They generally failed because Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democrats said the tariff should be only high enough to pay the government 's bills .
25366,"The Republicans , however , made high tariffs the centerpiece of their economic policy beginning in 1861 , and as late as 1930 ."
25367,Since 1930 tariffs have not been a major political issue .
25368,"Frederick Douglass ( born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey , c. February 1818 – February 20 , 1895 ) was an American social reformer , orator , writer and statesman ."
25369,"After escaping from slavery , he became a leader of the abolitionist movement , gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writing ."
25370,He stood as a living counter-example to slaveholders ' arguments that slaves did not have the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens .
25371,Many Northerners also found it hard to believe that such a great orator had been a slave .
25372,"Douglass wrote several autobiographies , eloquently describing his experiences in slavery in his 1845 autobiography , Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , an American Slave , which became influential in its support for abolition ."
25373,"He wrote two more autobiographies , with his last , Life and Times of Frederick Douglass , published in 1881 and covering events through and after the Civil War ."
25374,"After the Civil War , Douglass remained active in the United States ' struggle to reach its potential as a `` land of the free '' ."
25375,Douglass actively supported women 's suffrage .
25376,"Without his approval , he became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull on the impracticable and small Equal Rights Party ticket ."
25377,Douglass held multiple public offices .
25378,"Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all people , whether black , female , Native American , or recent immigrant , famously quoted as saying , `` I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong . ''"

25389,"Because of this , the name Lemony Snicket may refer to both a fictional character and a real person ."
25390,This article deals primarily with the character .
25391,"As a character , Snicket is a harried , troubled writer and researcher falsely accused of felonies and continuously hunted by the police and his enemies , the fire-starting side of the secret organization Volunteer Fire Department ( V.F.D . ) ."
25392,"As a child he was kidnapped and inducted as a `` neophyte '' into V.F.D. , where he was trained in rhetoric and sent on seemingly pointless missions while all connections to his former life , apart from his siblings Jacques and Kit ( who were also kidnapped and inducted ) , were severed ."
25393,"In the organization he met and fell in love with a peer named Beatrice , to whom he eventually became engaged ."
25394,"After a series of unfortunate events ( after which the real-world series is in some ways named ) , he became falsely accused of murder and arson ."

25403,A doctor draws blood from one of the Tuskegee test subjects
25404,The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African American men who thought they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government .
25405,"The Public Health Service , working with the Tuskegee Institute , began the study in 1932 ."
25406,"Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished sharecroppers from Macon County , Alabama ; 399 who had previously contracted syphilis before the study began , and 201 without the disease ."
25407,"For participating in the study , the men were given free medical care , meals , and free burial insurance ."
25408,"They were never told they had syphilis , nor were they ever treated for it ."
25409,"According to the Centers for Disease Control , the men were told they were being treated for `` bad blood '' , a local term for various illnesses that include syphilis , anemia , and fatigue ."
25410,The 40-year study was controversial for reasons related to ethical standards ; primarily because researchers knowingly failed to treat patients appropriately after the 1940s validation of penicillin as an effective cure for the disease they were studying .
25411,Revelation of study failures by a whistleblower led to major changes in U.S. law and regulation on the protection of participants in clinical studies .
25412,"Now studies require informed consent ( with exceptions possible for U.S. Federal agencies which can be kept secret by Executive Order ) , communication of diagnosis , and accurate reporting of test results ."
25413,"By 1947 , penicillin had become the standard treatment for syphilis ."
25414,"Choices available to the doctors involved in the study might have included treating all syphilitic subjects and closing the study , or splitting off a control group for testing with penicillin ."
25415,"Instead , the Tuskegee scientists continued the study without treating any participants and withholding penicillin and information about it from the patients ."
25416,"In addition , scientists prevented participants from accessing syphilis treatment programs available to others in the area ."
25417,"The study continued , under numerous US Public Health Service supervisors , until 1972 , when a leak to the press eventually resulted in its termination on November 16 ."

25800,Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives .
25801,"Democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal , development , and creation of laws ."
25802,"It encompasses social , economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination ."
25803,"The term originates from the Greek ( ' ) `` rule of the people '' , which was coined from δῆμος ( dêmos ) `` people '' and κράτος ( kratos ) `` power '' or `` rule '' in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city-states , notably Athens ; the term is an antonym to ( aristocratie ) `` rule of an elite '' ."
25804,"While theoretically these definitions are in opposition , in practice the distinction has been blurred historically ."
25805,"The political system of Classical Athens , for example , granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation ."
25806,"In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history , democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries ."
25807,"The English word dates to the 16th century , from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents ."
25808,"A democratic government contrasts to forms of government where power is either held by one , as in a monarchy , or where power is held by a small number of individuals , as in an oligarchy ."
25809,"Nevertheless , these oppositions , inherited from Greek philosophy , are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic , oligarchic , and monarchic elements ."
25810,"Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny , thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution ."
25811,"Several variants of democracy exist , but there are two basic forms , both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will ."
25812,"One form of democracy is direct democracy , in which all eligible citizens have direct and active participation in the decision making of the government ."
25813,"In most modern democracies , the whole body of all eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives ; this is called representative democracy ."
25814,"The concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the European Middle Ages , the Age of Enlightenment , and the American and French Revolutions ."

25846,The roller coaster is a popular amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks .
25847,"LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20 , 1885 , which were made out of wood , but this patent is considerably later than the `` Russian mountains '' described below ."
25848,"In essence a specialized railroad system , a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns , sometimes with one or more inversions ( such as vertical loops ) that briefly turn the rider upside down ."
25849,"The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit , as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate ."
25850,Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained .
25851,Two or more cars hooked together are called a train .

25853,"Bowers v. Hardwick , , is a United States Supreme Court decision , overturned in 2003 , that upheld , in a 5-4 ruling , the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults when applied to homosexuals ."
25854,"The majority opinion , written by Justice Byron White , argued that the Constitution did not confer `` a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy . ''"
25855,"A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited the `` ancient roots '' of prohibitions against homosexual sex , quoting William Blackstone 's description of homosexual sex as an `` infamous crime against nature '' , worse than rape , and `` a crime not fit to be named . ''"
25856,Burger concluded : `` To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching . ''
25857,"Justice Lewis F. Powell later said he regretted joining the majority , but thought the case of little importance at the time ."
25858,"The dissent , authored by Harry Blackmun , framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy ."
25859,Blackmun 's dissent accused the Court of an `` almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity '' and an `` overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases . ''
25860,"In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality , Blackmun wrote : `` That certain , but by no means all , religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry ."
25861,"The legitimacy of secular legislation depends , instead , on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine . ''"
25862,"Seventeen years after Bowers v. Hardwick , the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558 ( 2003 ) , and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional ."

25864,The colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates .
25865,It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided ( largely bacterial ) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs .
25866,"Unlike the small intestine , the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients ."
25867,"However , the colon does absorb water , sodium and some fat soluble vitamins ."

25870,"Martin Luther ( ; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546 ) was a German monk , former Catholic priest , professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in sixteenth century Christianity , subsequently known as the Protestant Reformation ."
25871,He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money .
25872,He confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517 .
25873,His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
25874,Luther taught that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin .
25875,His theology challenged the authority of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood .
25876,Those who identify with Luther 's teachings are called Lutherans .
25877,"His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture ."
25878,"It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the King James Bible ."
25879,His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches .
25880,"His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant priests to marry ."
25881,"In his later years , in deteriorating health , Luther became increasingly antisemitic , writing that Jewish homes should be destroyed , their synagogues burned , money confiscated and liberty curtailed ."
25882,These statements have contributed to his controversial status .
25883,"Wellness is generally used to mean a healthy balance of the mind , body and spirit that results in an overall feeling of well-being ."
25884,"It has been used in the context of alternative medicine since Halbert L. Dunn , M.D . , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s ."
25885,"The modern concept of wellness did not , however , become popular until the 1970s ."
25886,The term has been defined by the Wisconsin-based National Wellness Institute as an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a more successful existence .
25887,"URL_http This is consistent with a shift in focus away from illness in viewing human health , typical of contexts where the term wellness is used ."
25888,"In other words , wellness is a view of health that emphasizes the state of the entire being and its ongoing development ."
25889,The phrase can also be seen as an analogue to the medical term `` homeostasis `` .
25890,"Wellness can also be described as `` the constant , conscious pursuit of living life to its fullest potential . ''"
25891,"Halbert L. Dunn , M.D . , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s , based on a series of lectures at a Unitarian Universalist Church in Arlington , Virginia , in the United States ."
25892,"Dunn ( 196 , p. 4 ) defined wellness as `` an integrated method of functioning which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable ."
25893,It requires that the individual maintain a continuum of balance and purposeful direction within the environment where he is functioning . ''
25894,He also stated that `` wellness is a direction in progress toward an ever-higher potential of functioning '' ( p. 6 ) .
25895,"Alternative approaches to wellness are often denoted by the use of two different phrases : health and wellness , and wellness programs ."
25896,These kinds of wellness programs offer alternative medicine techniques to improve wellness .
25897,Whether these techniques actually improve physical health is controversial and a subject of much debate .
25898,James Randi and the James Randi Educational Foundation are outspoken critics of this alternative new age concept of wellness .
25899,"The behaviors in the pursuit of wellness often include many health related practices , such as natural therapies ."
25900,"Wellness , as a luxury pursuit , is found obviously in the more affluent societies because it involves managing the body state after the basic needs of food , shelter and basic medical care have already been met ."
25901,"Many of the practices applied in the pursuit of wellness , in fact , are aimed at controlling the side effects of affluence , such as obesity and inactivity ."
25902,"Wellness grew as a popular concept starting in the 19th century , just as the middle class began emerging in the industrialized world , and a time when a newly prosperous public had the time and the resources to pursue wellness and other forms of self-improvement ."

25907,Video demonstrating a chemical reaction .
25908,A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another .
25909,"Classically , chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms , with no change to the nuclei ( no change to the elements present ) , and can often be described by a chemical equation ."
25910,Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may both occur .
25911,The substance ( or substances ) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents .
25912,"Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change , and they yield one or more products , which usually have properties different from the reactants ."
25913,"Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps , the so-called elementary reactions , and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism ."
25914,"Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations , which graphically present the starting materials , end products , and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions ."
25915,"Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration , and rapid reactions are often described as spontaneous , requiring no input of extra energy other than thermal energy ."
25916,"Non-spontaneous reactions run so slowly that they are considered to require the input of some type of additional energy ( such as extra heat , light or electricity ) in order to proceed to completion ( chemical equilibrium ) at human time scales ."
25917,Different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product .
25918,"In biochemistry , a similar series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways ."
25919,These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes .
25920,"These enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions , so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions may be performed at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell ."
25921,"The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to non-chemical reactions between entities smaller than atoms , including nuclear reactions , radioactive decays , and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory ."
25922,"Mammoth Cave National Park is a U.S. National Park in central Kentucky , encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave , the longest cave system known in the world ."
25923,The official name of the system is the Mammoth-Flint Ridge Cave System for the ridge under which the cave has formed .
25924,"The park was established as a national park on July 1 , 1941 ."
25925,"It became a World Heritage Site on October 27 , 1981 , and an international Biosphere Reserve on September 26 , 1990 ."
25926,"The park 's are located primarily in Edmonson County , Kentucky , with small areas extending eastward into Hart County and Barren County ."
25927,"It is centered around the Green River , with a tributary , the Nolin River , feeding into the Green just inside the park ."

25929,The moons of Saturn ( also known as the natural satellites of Saturn ) are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan which is larger than the planet Mercury .
25930,"Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits , 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers ."
25931,"Saturn has seven moons that are large enough to be ellipsoidal due to having planetary mass , as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own ."
25932,"Particularly notable among Saturn 's moons are Titan , the second- largest moon in the Solar System , with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks ; and Enceladus , which emits jets of gas and dust and may harbor liquid water under its south pole region ."
25933,Twenty-four of Saturn 's moons are regular satellites ; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn 's equatorial plane .
25934,"They include the seven major satellites , four small moons which exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons , two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons which act as shepherds of Saturn 's F Ring ."
25935,Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn 's rings .
25936,The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan .
25937,"The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring , within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus ."
25938,The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn .
25939,"The remaining 38 , all small except one , are irregular satellites , whose orbits are much farther from Saturn , have high inclinations , and are mixed between prograde and retrograde ."
25940,"These moons are probably captured minor planets , or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured , creating collisional families ."
25941,"The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit , Norse , and Gallic groups , and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies ."
25942,"The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe , the ninth moon of Saturn , and was discovered at the end of the 19th century ."
25943,"The rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to hundreds of meters , each of which is on its own orbit about the planet ."
25944,"Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons can not be given , as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn 's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons ."
25945,"At least 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material , though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects ."
25946,A cannon is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile .
25947,"Cannon vary in caliber , range , mobility , rate of fire , angle of fire , and firepower ; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees , depending on their intended use on the battlefield ."
25948,"The word cannon is derived from several languages , in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube , cane , or reed ."
25949,"The plural of cannon is also cannon , though more commonly in America , cannons ."
25950,"In the modern era , the term cannon has fallen out of common usage , replaced by `` guns '' or `` artillery '' if not a more specific term such as `` mortar '' or `` howitzer '' ."
25951,"In aviation , cannon generally describes weapons firing bullets larger than 0.5 inches ( 12.7 mm ) in diameter ."
25952,"First used in China , cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery , and over time replaced siege engines —among other forms of aging weaponry—on the battlefield ."
25953,"In the Middle East , the first use of the hand cannon is argued to be during the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut between the Mamluks and Mongols ."
25954,"The first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia in the 11 and 12th centuries , and English cannon were first deployed in the Hundred Years ' War , at the Battle of Crécy , in 1346 ."
25955,"On the African continent , the cannon was first used by the Somali Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate in his conquest of Ethiopia in 1529 ."
25956,"It was during this period , the Middle Ages , that cannon became standardized , and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles ."
25957,"After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favor of greater numbers of lighter , more maneuverable pieces ."
25958,"In addition , new technologies and tactics were developed , making most defences obsolete ; this led to the construction of star forts , specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment though these too ( along with the Martello Tower ) would find themselves rendered obsolete when explosive and armour piercing rounds made even these types of fortifications vulnerable ."
25959,"Cannon also transformed naval warfare in the early modern period , as European navies took advantage of their firepower ."
25960,"As rifling became commonplace , the accuracy and destructive power of cannon was significantly increased , and they became deadlier than ever , both to infantry who belatedly had to adopt different tactics , and to ships , which had to be armoured ."
25961,"In World War I , the majority of combat fatalities were caused by artillery ; they were also used widely in World War II ."
25962,"Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War , although the importance of the larger caliber weapons has declined with the development of missiles ."
25963,The OpenID logo
25964,"OpenID is an open standard that allows users to be authenticated by certain co-operating sites ( known as Relying Parties or RP ) using a third party service , eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities ."
25965,"Users may create accounts with their preferred OpenID identity providers , and then use those accounts as the basis for signing on to any website which accepts OpenID authentication ."
25966,The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor ( the `` relying party '' ) .
25967,"An extension to the standard ( the OpenID Attribute Exchange ) facilitates the transfer of user attributes , such as name and gender , from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party ( each relying party may request a different set of attributes , depending on its requirements ) ."
25968,The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user 's identity .
25969,"Moreover , neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users , allowing for approaches ranging from the common ( such as passwords ) to the novel ( such as smart cards or biometrics ) ."
25970,"The term OpenID may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard ; these identifiers take the form of a unique URI , and are managed by some 'OpenID provider ' that handles authentication ."
25971,OpenID authentication is now used and provided by several large websites .
25972,"Providers include Google , Yahoo ! , PayPal , BBC , AOL , LiveJournal , MySpace , IBM , Steam , Sherdog , Orange and VeriSign ."
25973,Atherosclerosis ( also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD ) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride .
25974,"It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels , a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries , caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins ( LDL , plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides ) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins ( HDL ) ( see apoA-1 Milano ) ."
25975,It is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries .
25976,It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries .
25977,The atheromatous plaque is divided into three distinct components:
25978,"The atheroma ( `` lump of gruel , '' from ἀθήρα , athera , gruel in Greek ) , which is the nodular accumulation of a soft , flaky , yellowish material at the center of large plaques , composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the artery"
25979,Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
25980,Calcification at the outer base of older/more advanced lesions .
25981,"The following terms are similar , yet distinct , in both spelling and meaning , and can be easily confused : arteriosclerosis , arteriolosclerosis , and atherosclerosis ."
25982,"Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening ( and loss of elasticity ) of medium or large arteries ( from the Greek arteria , meaning artery , and , meaning hardening ) ; arteriolosclerosis is any hardening ( and loss of elasticity ) of arterioles ( small arteries ) ; atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque ."
25983,The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis .
25984,Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades .
25985,"Atherosclerotic lesions , or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories : Stable and unstable ( also called vulnerable ) ."
25986,"The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally , stable atherosclerotic plaques , which tend to be asymptomatic , are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while , unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen ( also known as the fibrous cap ) is usually weak and prone to rupture ."
25987,"Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material , such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen ."
25988,"Upon formation , intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright ( i.e . coronary occlusion ) , but more often they detach , move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism ( i.e . Stroke is often caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries ) ."
25989,"Apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen ."
25990,"Interestingly , chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue ( s ) is insufficient resulting in ischemia ."
25991,"These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic , slowly progressive and cumulative ."
25992,"Most commonly , soft plaque suddenly ruptures ( see vulnerable plaque ) , causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow , leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes ."
25993,This catastrophic event is called an infarction .
25994,"One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction ( a heart attack ) ."
25995,The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke .
25996,"Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs , typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots ."
25997,"Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree , but mostly larger , high-pressure vessels such as the coronary , renal , femoral , cerebral , and carotid arteries ."
25998,"These are termed `` clinically silent `` because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help , or when they do , physicians do not recognize what has happened ."
25999,Depiction of the classical model of the Triangular trade .
26000,"Triangular trade , or triangle trade , is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions ."
26001,Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come .
26002,Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying trade imbalances between the above regions .
26003,The particular routes were historically also shaped by the powerful influence of winds and currents during the age of sail .
26004,"For example , from the main trading nations of Western Europe it was much easier to sail westwards after first going south of 30 N latitude and reaching the so-called `` trade winds `` ; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the North American mainland ."
26005,"Returning from North America , it is easiest to follow the Gulf Stream in a northeasterly direction using the westerlies ."
26006,"A similar triangle to this , called the volta do mar lago was already being used by the Portuguese , before Columbus ' voyage , to sail to the Canary Island and the Azores ."
26007,"Columbus simply expanded the triangle outwards , and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach , and return from , the Americas ."
26008,"USS John F. Kennedy ( CV-67 ) ( formerly CVA-67 ) is the only ship of her class , a subclass of the Kitty Hawk-class aircraft carrier , and the last conventionally powered carrier built for the United States Navy ."
26009,"The ship is named after the 35th President of the United States , John F. Kennedy , and is nicknamed `` Big John . ''"
26010,"Kennedy was originally designated a CVA ( fixed wing attack carrier ) ; however , the designation was changed to CV to denote that the ship was capable of anti-submarine warfare , making her an all-purpose carrier ."
26011,"After nearly 40 years of service in the United States Navy , Kennedy was officially decommissioned on 1 August 2007 ."
26012,"She is berthed at the NAVSEA Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance facility in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ."
26013,She is available for donation as a museum and memorial to a qualified organization .
26014,The name has been adopted by the future Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy ( CVN-79 ) .
26015,Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood ( often shortened to simply Mister Rogers ) is an American children 's television series that was created and hosted by namesake Fred Rogers .
26016,"The series originated in 1963 as `` Misterogers '' on CBC ( Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ) television and was later debuted in 1966 as Mister Rogers ' Neighbourhood on television 6 on EEN , followed by its US network debut on February 19 , 1968 , and it aired on NET and its successor , PBS , until August 31 , 2001 ."
26017,"The series is aimed primarily at preschool ages 2 to 5 , but has been stated by PBS as `` appropriate for all ages '' ."
26018,"Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood was produced by Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , USA public broadcaster WQED and Rogers ' non-profit production company Family Communications , Inc. ; previously known as Small World Enterprises prior to 1971 , the company was renamed The Fred Rogers Company after Rogers ' death ."
26019,"The series could be seen in reruns on most PBS stations until August 29 , 2008 , when it was removed by PBS from their daily syndicated schedule along with Reading Rainbow , Boohbah , and Teletubbies ."
26020,"Despite this , a number of stations have chosen to continue airing it independently on the PBS feed ."
26021,"The snakeheads are members of the freshwater perciform fish family Channidae , native to Africa and Asia ."
26022,"These elongated , predatory fish are distinguished by a long dorsal fin , large mouth and shiny teeth ."
