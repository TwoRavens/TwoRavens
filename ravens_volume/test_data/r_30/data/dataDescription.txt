The Personae corpus was collected for experiments in Authorship Attribution and Personality 
Prediction. It consists of 145 Dutch-language essays, written by 145 different students (BA in Linguistics and 
Literature at the University of Antwerp, Belgium). Each student also took an online MBTI personality test, 
allowing personality prediction experiments. The corpus was controlled for topic, register, genre, age, and 
education level. The original texts are made available, a syntactically annotated version of the texts, and 
the metadata. The corpus is split into 116 training sample  texts and 29 test sample texts.
