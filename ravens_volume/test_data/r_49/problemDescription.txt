49_facebook is an instance of the Graph Matching problem. It is also
referred to as the multiple-anonymized-network alignment problem.

In this problem two graphs are given, G1 and G2, representing 
two social networks. People nowadays are normally involved in multiple
social networks. Many of these networks can share common structure information 
(e.g. friendship connections) due to either analogous network establishing 
purpose or because of similar network features. But the networks are usually
anonymized for privacy concerns. The task is to take two anonymized networks
and find correspondence among the users across the two networks.

In this problem, G1 is a subgraph of the Facebook social network. Nodes are attributed 
and represent the users in this network.

G2 is extracted from the max connected component of G1 with sufficient noise added 
(some new nodes/edges are randomly introduced and some existing nodes/edges are randomly removed). 
The nodes of G2 are relabeled. G2 is a proxy for a second anonymized social network (e.g., twitter
or foursquare) where some of the same users are present.

A partial map of the matching nodes between G1 and G2 are provided in the train data. This 
map represents "anchor links" or known correspondences between users across the two networks.

The task is to predict the rest of the mapping between the matching nodes in the test data.
