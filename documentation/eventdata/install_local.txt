Updated process for MID/GED/GTD/Terrier datasets:
0. verify that all columns in the dataset consist of atomic data. if not, split the data entry so it is atomic
1. construct the date columns (see 2_construct_dates.py and date_standardization.py)
	resulting columns:	TwoRavens_start date
						TwoRavens_end date
						TwoRavens_date info
2. construct the location columns (see scripts 3-8, and refer to the ones wiht *new.py)
	minimum resulting columns:	TwoRavens_country
								TwoRavens_country_historic (if date present and original regional data present)
3. construct actor columns if countries used as source/targets
	minimum resulting columns:	TwoRavens_country_src
								TwoRavens_country_tgt
								TwoRavens_country_historic_src
								TwoRavens_country_historic_tgt
4. export the database: mongodump -d event_data -c <COLLECTION> --archive=<PATH TO DUMP FILE> --gzip
5. scp the dump files to the remote server: scp <PATH TO DUMP FILE> <SERVER>:<PATH TO DUMP>
6. restore the dump files: mongorestore --archive=<PATH TO ARCHIVE> --gzip --nsFrom "<ORIGINAL DB.*" --nsTo "<NEW DB>.*"

For datasets that do not have an aggregated field (eg Terrier's actor fields), to create one by merging existing fields, use:
db.<collection>.aggregate([{$addFields: {"TwoRavens_source_actor": {$concat: ["$<field1>", "$<field2>", ...]}, "TwoRavens_target_actor": {$concat: ["$<field3>", "$<field4>", ...]}}}, {$out: "<collection>"}])


1. If on windows, use Ubuntu on a virtualbox to prevent this error:
      Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8000/custom/eventdataapp. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).

2. Install mongodb. Queries are tested to work on version 3.6, but 4.0 should not break compatibility.
    Ubuntu: DO NOT do the obvious `sudo apt-get install mongo`, that package is unofficial. Use this link:
    https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
    OS X: install via Brew
    https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

3. Start a mongo server. Server port is 27017 by default
     run `mongod` or if that doesn't work, `sudo service mongod start`
     If you get an error about `/data/db`, then create the folder `/data/db` in the root directory.
     For a custom config file:
     `mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`

4. There is a sequence of scripts to run in `tworaven_apps/eventdata_queries/initialization/`.
    For many of the scripts, mongod must be running, and pymongo must be installed in your python interpreter. Python 3 features were used.
    To just bootstrap a local dev environment, the arcgis scripts for rich location data doesn't have to be run.
        The data for constructing location columns is either computed via arcgis, or loaded from a mongoexport database dump. The dump is not in this repository.

     If you are just doing a local setup, then skip scripts 3-7 and just run 8.
     Scripts 3-6 are for constructing arcgis locations, and 7 is for applying them to your datasets.
     Step 8 will fill in missing country fields from steps 3-7, but is sufficient alone to be able to run a local setup.
    If you are going to be updating the production database, then the richer ArcGIS location data needs to be in the database before running `install_remote.txt`

5. Run 'fab run_eventdata_dev' to get Django running. Requests for data pass through endpoints in `/tworavens_apps/eventdata_queries/`

6. If you still have problems with CORS, try to permit CORS on your browser. This doesn't seem to work on Windows
     7a. Google Chrome: start with terminal argument
            google-chrome --disable-web-security
      b. Mozilla Firefox: in about:config settings
            security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy - set to False


To get eventdata running after initial setup:
`fab run_eventdata_dev`
`mongod`


Example snippet on mongo shell usage:
```
> show collections
cline_phoenix_fbis
cline_phoenix_nyt
> db.cline_phoenix_nyt.find().count()
1092211
> db.cline_phoenix_fbis.find().count(0
... )
817955
>
```
