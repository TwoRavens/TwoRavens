# Vagrant install

This is the only tested method to run TwoRavens on Windows, but also works on anything with Vagrant support. To get started:

1) download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2) download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

(you almost certainly want the 64-bit versions)
