The following is a hypothetical set of messages from a user session for a D3M problem.


Note on JSON's from frontend:
=============================
The JSON's from the frontend are sent as strings.
The JSON strings currently have a name prepended as string to the JSON.   For example the estimate message has "solaJSON=" before the JSON
The quote character " actually comes as \"


Note on Protocol Buffers to/from TA2:
=====================================
The protocol buffers are encoded binary, so the representation below is not how they appear on the wire. 

Note the standards are for messages to be CamelCase, fields to be lower_case_underscore_separated, and values to ALL_CAPS_UNDERSCORE_SEPARATED, 
which helps in interpreting a little:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style


But the way I'm describing them seems to be a standard way to textually represent the decoded message.
You can interpret the following message:
OneMessage{
	some_field = 3 : "HELLO"
}

to read as Message "A", send Field "b" with Value "3" which via the defined codebook enumerates to "HELLO" 
Messages are made up of fields, which have predefined types.  However, the type of a field can itself be a message, 
thus messages can be wrapped inside other messages such as:
TwoMessage{
	ThreeMessage{
		field_d = "some string"            // a string
		field_e = 2 : "FAILED"             // an integer (2), that has an enumerated meaning ("FAILED"), given by the gRPC code
	}
	field_f = "something else"
}



Messages
========

// Message [A1] from Django to TA2 to start session

SessionRequest {
    user_agent = "TwoRavensUser";     // or some name ID for us
    version = "2017.8.23";            // version numbering for the protocol buffer defintion, which are presently release dates
}


// Message [A2] from TA2 to Django as response to [A1]

SessionResponse {
    Response {                        // Note "Response" is a common message, used on it's own as a common response to a request, and here embedded with other details
		Status {
