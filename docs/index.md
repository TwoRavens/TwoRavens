**TwoRavens** is a Web-based platform for statistical analysis. The goal is to allow the domain expert, in concert with our system, to complete a high quality, predictive and interpretable model without a statistical expert. To do so, the system facilitates intuitive machine learning and model interpretation, model discovery, and data exploration. As our intelligent back-end automatically seeks interesting relationships in the data and builds models to predict outcomes, researchers impart substantive knowledge about their data and own research questions to guide the automated generation of AI assistance for data analysis in an interactive paradigm we call human-guided machine learning.

**TwoRavens for Event Data** is designed for researchers to easily structure raw event data into usable time-series formats. Researchers can browse openly available event datasets, construct queries to select types of events and sets of actors, and view and download resulting time-series data. Dates and locations are standardized across datasets to allow for comparisons and identical queries.

**TwoRavens Metadata Service** is our data profiler. It provides the summary information used by our main application to visualize and explore data. Researchers may pip install this component for local use.
