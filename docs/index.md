**TwoRavens** is a Web application for statistical modeling. Given a dataset, it automatically identifies interesting relationships and builds models to predict outcomes. Researchers impart substantive knowledge to define new problems and build better models to help solve their research question.

# Applications

The project has 3 core applications:
* [D3M](/D3M/index.md) Date-Driven Discovery of Models interface.
* [Event Data](/EventData/index.md) provides access to openly available event datasets.
* [Metadata Service](/Metadata/index.md)
