Install jsdocs: npm install -g jsdoc

To generate documentation:
1. for each separate page of docs you want, make a seperate directory for the generated HTML files
2. change to that directory, and run jsdoc to make documentation into that folder: jsdoc <path to js files> <path to markdown>
2.a. if you just want to convert markdown to html, create an empty .js file and run the jsdoc command
3. repeat steps 1-2 for each separate page
4. cd to TwoRavens root, and remove all .html files
5. run jsdoc on the base README.md and general TwoRavens js files: jsdoc assets/app/*.js README.md
6. copy everything from the out folder to root
7. for each page generated, edit the index.html files to link to each other in the nav bars and add any customizations
