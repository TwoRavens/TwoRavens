API Documentation
=================

This document briefly introduces the main function of each component and each framework we used in our D3M interface.
We only provide limited description about corresponding frameworks, please refer to their homepage if you have further question.

Overview
========

Our D3M interface can be split into two main components: D3M Configuration (front-end) and TA2 Interface (back-end).
We built the front-end using Django framework, which extends MVC (Model, View and Controller) to MVT (Model, View and Template).
More specific, the **Template** is a presentation layer which handles User Interface part completely.
All the web pages you saw are generated by Template. The View is used to execute the business logic and interact with a model.
Thus, **View** contains the logic code and **Model** plays the role of database.

D3M Configuration
=================

This application constructs the web page you can see. It will generate url based on your operation and pass it to the **View** component.
After that, **View** will execute corresponding logic code based on the input urls.
